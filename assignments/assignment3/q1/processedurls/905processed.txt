Cage leaks training materials for Prevent anti-extremism strategy

   Campaign group says manuals and videos for public sector workers on
   spotting signs of radicalisation are ‘naive and dangerous’

   Training manuals and videos used to train public sector workers on how
   to spot signs of radicalisation were leaked by [56]Cage, the group that
   campaigns on behalf of communities affected by the war on terrorism.

   On Wednesday Cage released a slew of documents used to train teachers,
   doctors and local government officials to deal with individuals who are
   vulnerable to extremism. The material, said Cage, will be hosted on a
   website for researchers and academics.

   Since last year there has been [57]a legal obligation on councils,
   prisons, NHS trusts and schools to tackle radicalisation as part of the
   £120m, 10-year Prevent programme. Cage obtained details of “workshops
   to raise awareness of Prevent”, more commonly referred to as Wrap
   training.

   communities'

   Cage said it made the material public after freedom of information
   requests by the group were rebuffed on the grounds of national
   security.

   The group said Whitehall officials had claimed “that if the programme
   was to be exposed publicly, it would be undermined, as potential
   terrorists would know better how to avoid detection”.

   However, on examining the documents, Cage said: “The training gives
   very little actual information other than very general advice. Further,
   the emphasis of the training is on finding factors where an individual
   may be drawn into terrorism, thus not someone who is already committed
   to a path and might seek to evade detection.”

   The Wrap documents show that Prevent is concerned with rightwing
   extremists as well as religious radicalisation of Muslims. Other
   documents ask a series of questions to gauge how well Prevent duties
   are understood by public sector workers. For example, higher education
   staff are quizzed as to what proportion of campuses restrict the right
   to free speech. The answer is 80%, a figure obtained by an online
   magazine last year.

   Related: [59]Rules to fight extremism ‘creating fear among teachers and
   pupils’

   Cage claims a growing list of senior public figures have spoken out
   against the government programmes – with more than 300 professors,
   academics, experts and community figures signing letters opposing
   Prevent.

   High-profile campaigns by religious leaders and mosques in east London
   [60]have called for a boycott of the government’s anti-terrorism
   programmes, accusing the policies of being a racist attack on the
   Islamic community.

   Ibrahim Mohamoud, Cage’s communications officer, said: “The assumption
   that public sector workers can be trained in a few hours on a complex
   issue such as understanding the pathways to politically motivated
   violence is naive and dangerous. As Cage predicted more than a year
   ago, the implementation of Prevent is leading to over-reporting and
   several high-profile cases of overreach.”

   A Home Office source pointed out that many of the documents released
   were already in the public domain. “More than 350,000 people over the
   last five years have taken part in the Wrap training. There is no way
   it was secret,” said the source.

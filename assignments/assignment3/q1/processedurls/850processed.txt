The Big Idea: Artificial pancreas for diabetics

   Alecia Wesner has type 1 diabetes. "I was diagnosed in 1979 when i was
   six years old. That was really the dark ages of diabetes," said Wesner.

   NEW YORK (FOX 5 NY) - Alecia Wesner has type 1 diabetes.

   "I was diagnosed in 1979 when I was 6 years old. That was really the
   dark ages of diabetes," said Wesner.

   She has worried about her type 1 diabetes for most of her life.

   "There's no break from it. it's 24/7," said Wesner.

   As a diabetic, Wesner wears an insulin pump and a continuous glucose
   monitor.

   "During the day, I can keep an eye on what my blood sugar is. I can
   make adjustments during the day as quickly as possible. At night, it's
   a totally different game," said Wesner.

   "Between two and three million Americans are currently living with type
   1 diabetes, and they have to keep an eye on their blood sugar all day,
   and all night. But what if there was something that could do it for
   them?"

   Enter a groundbreaking system called the artificial pancreas.

   "We call this the artificial pancreas because we're trying to replace
   what nature unfortunately took away in diabetes with a machine, said
   Aaron Kowalski, chief mission officer at JDRF, which is funding
   research on the artificial pancreas.

   Here's how it works -- the patient would still wear a continuous
   glucose monitor and an insulin pump. But now, the two devices would be
   able to communicate wirelessly through Bluetooth technology on a
   smartphone -- and dispense insulin automatically -- using real-time
   data.

   "This will be transformative, because it will take a lot of the
   management burden off the shoulders of people with diabetes. Computers
   can outperform people in a lot of things that we do. the computer in
   this system which is just software in an app on the cellphone - watches
   the glucose level all of the time. and it's very sophisticated
   mathematics," said Kowalski.

   "It's the decision maker. It will say wait, I see the blood glucose
   levels changing. You need more insulin. Wait, the sugars are dropping.
   You need less insulin," said Dr. Carol Levy, Director, Mount
   Sinai Diabetes Center.

   In November she led a five day clinical study of the artificial
   pancreas, and the results were incredible.

   "We would be watching them on a computerized system throughout the
   night, and almost sometimes cheering with how wonderful the system
   worked. They don't have to worry about getting up at three in the
   morning, doing the finger stick...it takes care of it beautifully and
   they wake up with a great blood sugar level," said Dr. Levy.

   Dr. Levy has a personal stake in the research; she, too, has type 1
   diabetes.

   "It's huge. because it's world changing. and life changing for people
   with diabetes. It's almost like having a little doctor follow you
   around all the time," said Dr. Levy.

   There were 10 participants in the study, among them was Alecia -- a
   patient of Dr. Levy's.

   "When you heard about the results, what was your reaction? Crying.
   Absolutely. It's one thing to hear about it, it's another to have it on
   your body. The hardest part was giving it back," said Alecia.

   More research is still being done, but the device is expected to be
   approved by the FDA in the next few years.

   "In the next two years or so we're going to have people wearing these
   in the real world," said Kowalski.

   "Research in the lab is wonderful, but this is something a patient can
   visualize and have hope for," said Levy.

   And for Wesner, the artificial pancreas means people diagnosed with
   diabetes in the future will have a different life than she had. A life
   with less worry and more freedom.

   "To think that this could really happen and change people's lives  --
   it's an enormous responsibility - and a level of excitement that I
   don't think i could put into words," said Wesner.

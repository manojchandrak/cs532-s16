   Votes: Chris Grayling pushed the new rule, arguing naming arrested MPs
   breaches their right to privacy

   Parliament voted to keep MPs arrests a secret tonight, under new rules
   pushed through by Tory minister Chris Grayling.

   In a chilling move, debated for less than an hour, the [122]House of
   Commons decided the public have no right to know if their MP is
   arrested

   Just one MP voted against the new rules.

   Until now, the names of members placed under arrest was a matter of
   public record and was announced to the House by Speaker [123]John
   Bercow.

   But after last night's vote, there will be no public record of an MP
   being arrested unless the MP outs him or herself.

   BBC Chair of the Procedure Committee, Charles Walker, gave an
   impassioned speech backing and praising John Bercow during a debate in
   parliament about changes to the way the Speaker is elected
   Defence: Charles Walker dismissed anger over the new rules as "faux
   sound and fury"

   The motion was tabled by Tory Leader of the House [124]Chris Grayling,
   arguing the naming of MPs under arrest breached their "right to
   privacy" under the Human Rights Act.

   While he was Justice Secretary, Mr Grayling led Government plans to
   scrap the Human Rights Act.

   Tory MP Charles Walker, who chairs the Commons Procedure Committee,
   dismissed [125]anger over the rule change as "faux sound and fury".

   But Labour's John Mann was a lonely voice of opposition to the change.

   He told the Mirror: "It gives an additional level of protection to MPs
   that is unwarranted.

   "If an MP is arrested on child abuse charges then it should be made
   public. Indeed, now this could happen and a general election could take
   place with voters not knowing.

   "Of course, MPs are innocent until proven guilty, but if the law is to
   be changed, it should be for everyone, not just MPs."

   PA Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow
   Tradition: Previously Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow would
   declare arrests

   There is no law specifically preventing the naming of people under
   arrest.

   Police decide whether or not to name an arrested person based on a
   balance of the suspect's right to privacy and the public's right to
   know.

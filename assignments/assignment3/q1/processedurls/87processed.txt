   Startup Yumanity Therapeutics Closes on $45 Million, With Biogen and
   Sanofi-Genzyme BioVentures Joining In
   February 10, 2016
   By [27]Mark Terry, BioSpace.com Breaking News Staff
   Cambridge, Mass.-based [28]Yumanity Therapeutics [29]announced a $45
   million Series A financing round today. Led by Fidelity Management &
   Research Company, participants included Redmile Group, Alexandria
   Venture Investments, [30]Biogen ([31]BIIB), Sanofi-Genzyme BioVentures
   and Dolby Family Ventures.
   In addition, John Cox, executive vice president of therapeutic
   operations at Biogen, and Joel Marcus, chairman, chief executive
   officer and founder of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc./Alexandria
   Venture Investments, join the company’s board of directors.
   Yumanity was [32]founded by Tony Coles, who is also the chief executive
   officer and chair. Coles is best known for founding [33]Onyx
   Pharmaceuticals, which he sold to [34]Amgen ([35]AMGN) for $10.4
   billion. Yumanity’s technical foundation is research from Susan
   Lindquist’s laboratory at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical
   Research, which focuses on protein misfolding, a key concept in
   Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease, and Lou Gehrig’s disease (amyotrophic
   lateral sclerosis).
   Coles and Lindquist worked together previously as board members of
   [36]FoldRx Pharmaceuticals, which was bought by [37]Pfizer ([38]PFE) in
   2010. The two invested their own money in starting Yumanity in 2014,
   hiring the first 15 employees and various instrumentation needed.
   Lindquist does not work for the company, but [39]chairs the scientific
   advisory board.
   Of his new investors, Coles told Forbes, “I’d characterize the group as
   smart money, and money that understands the science behind what we’re
   trying to accomplish. One of the biggest challenges of the industry is
   we just don’t understand the biology of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s
   very well. We’ve got some basic work to do on the basic mechanisms, and
   then we can train our guns of drug discovery on those mechanisms.”

   The company’s early work has been focused on creating its own type of
   drug discovery engine. As Forbes describes it, “The company uses a
   yeast-based system to identify promising molecular pathways that appear
   to go awry in neurodegeneration.”
   It also has pulled in induced pluripotent stem cell technologies that
   allow the company to actually create human neurons in a Petri dish from
   skin cells collected from patients.
   The managing director of Sanofi-Genzyme Bioventures, Bernard Davitian,
   notes that his firm looks for breakthrough science, areas of unmet
   medical need, world-class investors and management teams. “Clearly,
   Yumanity Therapeutics fits this description,” he told Forbes, “and Tony
   (Coles) is an outstanding leader. We are excited by Yumanity’s new
   paradigm to transform drug discovery in this area.”
   The company plans to use the $45 million to move toward human testing,
   although Coles is unwilling to provide a timeline. Everyone seems to
   understand that work in the areas of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s
   disease is complicated and will take time. Between 2002 and 2012, only
   a single drug for Alzheimer’s out of 244 that were in clinical trials
   made it to market. Some of this is related to a lack of understanding
   of the fundamental nature of the diseases. Although it appears that
   beta-amyloid plaque buildup, tau tangles, inflammation and problems in
   cell trafficking play a role, what those roles are, when they occur and
   to what extent is still unknown.
   “Several things may be going awry,” Coles told Forbes. “We may need
   combo therapies attacking each of those aspects, and maybe different
   drugs at different stages of disease.”
   Yumanity as yet has no drug to test in the clinic, focusing instead on
   developing its approach and research engine. It also plans to hire an
   additional 10 people.
   The inclusion of Biogen in the investors is particularly interesting,
   in that the company has recently made a [47]pivot from its focus on
   multiple sclerosis towards Alzheimer’s research and development. Coles
   notes that Biogen’s focus is on developing drugs to cut the
   accumulation of amyloid in the brain. Yumanity focuses primarily on
   protein misfolding.
   “We’re unbiased and not after a single mechanism unless a cell points
   in a specific direction,” Coles [48]told the Boston Business Journal.
   “Biogen started in a presumption that amyloid is important, so if we
   can clear it, that is a good thing. We’re asking a broader question:
   What is the way we can treat Alzheimer’s? We’re asking the cell to tell
   us.”

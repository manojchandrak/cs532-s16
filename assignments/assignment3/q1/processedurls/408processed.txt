Biomedical Researcher Earns Respected Keck Award

   February 10, 2016
   The W.M. Keck Foundation has given UC Merced Professor Victor Muñoz $1
   million over the next five years to advance biomedical research
   By Lorena Anderson, University Communications
   Quick Facts:
   Biology is one of the fastest growing areas of study at UC Merced.
   The highly competitive Keck Award supports high-risk, high-reward
   research.
   Only a handful of Keck awards are given out each year.

   Professor Victor Muñoz [49]Professor Victor Muñoz’s novel approach to
   advancing biomedical research has earned him the campus’s first
   prestigious Keck Award, including $1 million over the next five years.

   The University of California, Merced, professor was chosen by the W.M.
   Keck Foundation, which focuses primarily on pioneering efforts in the
   areas of medical, science and engineering research.

   “This is a fantastic first for UC Merced, and it points to the growing
   recognition of the important research being conducted on the campus,”
   School of Engineering Dean Mark Matsumoto said. “Professor Muñoz
   exemplifies the outstanding quality of our faculty.”

   Muñoz plans to design and engineer a new kind of protein he previously
   discovered to create miniscule biosensors that can measure even slight
   changes inside cells and provide high-resolution, highly specific
   information in real time.

   A bioengineer who joined UC Merced’s [50]School of Engineering in 2014,
   Muñoz said he has been looking at these special kinds of proteins for
   more than a dozen years, but it’s only now that he has found practical
   ways to turn them into super-performing biosensors.

   “They are, simply, devices that can selectively detect the levels of
   biologically relevant compounds, such as hormones or drugs, or even key
   biological processes such as aging and the onset of disease,”
   Muñoz said.

   But current biosensors only answer simple questions: Is someone
   pregnant? What is the current percentage of sugar in a diabetic’s
   bloodstream? And often, it takes time — including sending results to
   labs for analysis — to get answers.

   Until now, creating these nano-sized sensors — thousands of times
   smaller than the width of a human hair — hasn’t been possible because
   of the limitations on the proteins researchers typically use to bind to
   the molecules they are searching for.

   But while studying how proteins fold themselves into their functional
   3-D shapes, Muñoz and coworkers at his previous labs, first at the
   University of Maryland and then at the Spanish National Research
   Council, discovered a new set of proteins that behave differently
   because they fold gradually rather than in a single stroke.

   “They were theoretically predicted, but we found them and have been
   working for a long time to understand what makes them so special,”
   Muñoz said. “My goal now is to use them to build better sensors that
   can detect a broader range of changes with very high resolution inside
   living cells that could be used in ways that have never been
   possible before.”

   Developing these sensors requires using a multidisciplinary approach in
   which protein engineering and design is combined with single-molecule
   fluorescence microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, theoretical
   modeling and high-performance computations.

   If successful, the new sensors will help researchers understand not
   just that something inside a cell has changed, but when, by exactly how
   much and over what period of time. That could lead to being able to
   answer the “why” of various biomedical questions, too.

   “Professor Muñoz’s research represents a fundamental paradigm shift in
   the technology of biosensors,” Vice Chancellor for Research Sam Traina
   said. “While the initial proposed applications would be in the areas of
   medicine and human health, if successful, this approach could readily
   be applied to other topics such as discrete corrosion science,
   environmental sensing and materials research. We are extremely excited
   about the new opportunities that might result from the work of
   Professor Muñoz and his colleagues.”

   The W.M. Keck Foundation gives only a handful of research grants each
   year through a highly competitive process. There are two categories for
   research awards: medical, and science and engineering, and each campus
   is allowed only one entry in each category. Muñoz’s award falls under
   the medical research category.

   “What’s unusual about these awards is that the Keck Foundation supports
   new, high-risk, high-reward research projects that might not be as far
   along in development,” Muñoz said.

   The foundation focuses on important and emerging areas of research that
   have the potential to develop breakthrough technologies,
   instrumentation or methodologies; are innovative, distinctive and
   interdisciplinary; use unconventional approaches or can challenge
   prevailing paradigms; and have the potential to be transformative —
   such as founding a new field of research, enabling observations not
   previously possible or altering perceptions of a previously
   intractable problem.

   Muñoz plans to collaborate with others on campus. The bulk of the work
   in the next few years will be in developing a set of principles for
   creating the sensors. Muñoz and his lab will use them to measure pH,
   salinity and calcium ion levels in cells, but he said that once the
   basic principles are formulated, sensors could be created to detect any
   molecules researchers want.

   Muñoz said he will officially name his lab the W.M. Keck Research Lab,
   and start a Ph.D. fellowship — the W.M. Keck Research Fellowship in
   Bioengineering — to honor student excellence in biophysics and
   biomedical research.

   Sheraton Hotels & Resorts

   [13]Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (NYSE:[14]HOT) today
   announced that it will bring its iconic Sheraton brand to the upmarket
   resort town of Cascais in Portugal with the signing of the Sheraton
   Cascais Resort. Owned and managed by United Investments Portugal (UIP),
   the property will join the Sheraton brand on February 24^th, 2016 under
   a franchise agreement with Starwood.

   "We have successfully partnered with United Investments Portugal for
   over 24-years at Pine Cliffs, a Luxury Collection Resort in the
   Algarve, positioning it as one of the finest resorts in Europe. We are
   extremely proud to extend this collaboration and bring a third Sheraton
   hotel to Portugal," said Michael Wale, President, Starwood Hotels &
   Resorts, Europe, Africa and Middle East. "The signing of this fantastic
   hotel underlines our strong relationship with UIP and highlights the
   continued demand for the Sheraton brand as we move toward our goal of
   adding 150 new Sheraton hotels around the globe by the year 2020."

   Sheraton Cascais Resort, which previously operated as the Vivamarinha
   Hotel & Suites, boasts an enviable location on Portugal's sweeping
   Atlantic coast just 30 minutes from Lisbon and about a mile from the
   famous Guincho Beach, one of the finest surfing spots in Europe.
   Comprising of 138 rooms and suites, Sheraton Cascais will feature a
   signature restaurant and two bars, as well as a wide range of leisure
   facilities including a state-of-the-art fitness centre, outdoor
   swimming pool and an expansive spa with six treatment rooms and
   hydrotherapy suite. A perfect location for golfers, the resort is
   surrounded by seven of Portugal's top golf courses, all within a
   30-minute drive – one for each day of the week. Business guests will
   enjoy a range of multifunctional meeting rooms, the largest
   accommodating up to 150 people.

   "We are extremely pleased to expand and strengthen our relationship
   with Starwood Hotels & Resorts," said Talal Al-Bahar, Chairman, United
   Investments Portugal. "Having jointly positioned Pine Cliffs, a Luxury
   Collection Resort, as the leading resort in Portugal and one of the
   finest in Europe, we look forward to bringing similar success to the
   Sheraton Cascais Resort, elevating this magnificent property to the
   same level, standards and service that we have created at Pine Cliffs."

   Sheraton Cascais Resort will complement the two existing Sheraton
   properties in Portugal - Sheraton Lisbon Hotel & Spa and Sheraton Porto
   Hotel & Spa.

   "United Investments Portugal has been a key partner for Starwood since
   the opening of Pine Cliffs Resort in 1992," said Felicity
   Black-Roberts, Senior Director Development, Starwood Hotels & Resorts,
   Europe, Africa and Middle East. "We are committed to working with the
   right partners on the right properties in order to deliver great
   returns to our owners. With the strong partnership between United
   Investments Portugal and Starwood, we are sure that Sheraton Cascais
   will be a success."

   In June 2015, Starwood Hotels & Resorts launched Sheraton 2020, a
   comprehensive 10-point plan designed to put Sheraton Hotels and Resorts
   firmly back into the global spotlight. Sheraton 2020 includes a
   multi-million marketing campaign; the launch of the new premier tier,
   Sheraton Grand; continuous innovation of the Sheraton guest experience;
   and a goal of adding more than 150 new Sheraton hotels worldwide by

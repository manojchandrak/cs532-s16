   Bay City’s Tall Ship Celebration will return to the region from July 14
   to July 17.

   The Bay City site has won the coveted “Port of the Year” award from
   Tall Ships America three times, more than any other host community in
   all of North America. Event organizers have been busy wrapping up
   details for the sixth event in 15 years.

   The only official host port in Michigan for the Tall Ships Challenge
   Great Lakes, Bay City event organizers are hoping their efforts will
   bring home the title once again.

   Nine companies have signed on to join presenting sponsor Dow Corning
   Corp. as major ship sponsors: The Dow Chemical Co., FirstMerit Bank
   (also as Citizens Bank), MLive Media Group, St. Mary’s of Michigan,
   Independent Bank, Wildfire Credit Union, Consumers Energy, McLaren Bay
   Region and Chemical Bank.

   “The companies and organizations that have agreed to invest in Tall
   Ship Celebration recognize the importance of the event to our community
   and our region,” said Kathy Czerwinski, chair of the Tall Ship
   Celebration Board of Directors. “Representing the state of Michigan to
   the tall ship fleet, the other Great Lakes states and the more than
   100,000 people from around the world who are expected to attend is a
   humbling and daunting task. It would not be possible without the
   strategic investment of our sponsors.”

   On July 14, 12 vessels will sail up the Saginaw River to downtown Bay
   City. Ten will remain dockside and will be available for touring July
   15 through July 17. Bay City’s own tall ships, Appledore IV and V, will
   provide sail away trips. With appearance fees ranging from $12,000 to
   $45,000, the cost to secure the 2016 fleet is expected to be about
   $215,000.

   New to the Great Lakes and the Bay City event are El Galeón Andalucía,
   a 160-foot replica of a 16th-17th century

   Spanish galleon; Draken Harald Hårfagre, a 115-foot. replica of a
   traditional Viking long boat; and When and If, an 83- foot schooner
   built for General George S. Patton in 1939.

   Returning vessels include the Pride of Baltimore II, a 157-foot
   Baltimore clipper, and Madeline, a 95-foot gaff topsail schooner from
   Traverse City, perennial favorites at every Bay City event since 2001.
   The Flagship Niagara is a 198-foot brig from Erie, Pa., that appeared
   at the Bay City festival in 2006 and 2013; Denis Sullivan is a 137-foot
   3-masted schooner from Milwaukee, Wisc., that appeared in 2010 and
   2013; and Mist of Avalon is a 100-foot 2-masted gaff schooner that
   hasn’t appeared since 2003.

   Negotiations are ongoing to secure two additional vessels.

   The Tall Ships Challenge is a series of races and rallies produced
   annually by Tall Ships America, a nonprofit membership organization
   based in Newport, R.I. The event rotates among the east and west coast
   of the United States and the Great Lakes.

   Tall Ship Celebration: Bay City hosts the fleet when it visits the
   Great Lakes; Bay City has been the only official host port in the state
   of Michigan since 2006.

   BaySail, a non-profit educational organization that owns and operates
   the tall ships Appledore IV and V, is producing the 2016 maritime
   festival on behalf of the Tall Ship Celebration Board of Directors.

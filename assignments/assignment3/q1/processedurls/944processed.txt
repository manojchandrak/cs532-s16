Yahoo plans first wave of job cuts

   Yahoo made the announcement on Wednesday that it will be laying off 107
   of the company's employees. This number is an initial one, as the
   company plans to make more than 1.500 job cuts. USA TODAY

   Yahoo has made official its first wave of job cuts under its
   revitalization plan.

   The Sunnyvale, Calif. online and mobile advertising and content company
   gave 60-day notices to 107 employees at its headquarters in a state
   labor report filed Wednesday.

   The layoffs, which take effect April 11, are the first of an
   expected 1,500-plus job cuts and were spread across a range of
   departments and job titles.

   “As part of our strategic plan, we have made the difficult but
   necessary decision to reduce our workforce in order to more efficiently
   align resources and position the company for a stronger future. We will
   provide more clarity to our employees who are impacted by these
   decisions in the coming weeks," the company said in a statement emailed
   to USA TODAY.

   Earlier this month, the struggling Net company [70]announced plans to
   cut about 15% of its workforce as part of a $400 million cost-cutting
   effort meant to "simplify" its operations.

   Yahoo is also exploring the sale of non-strategic assets, such as real
   estate, that could raise $1 billion in cash. And the company's board is
   looking at "strategic alternatives" that include a sale of some or all
   of Yahoo's core Net business.
   "We believe a simplified Yahoo will increase shareholder value over the
   long term,” said CEO Marissa Mayer last week during the company's
   earnings call Tuesday. “Having fewer products means we can improve
   those products faster and increase profitability and focus.”

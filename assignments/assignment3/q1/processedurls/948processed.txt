English votes system 'unstable' warn MPs

     * 11 February 2016
     * From the section [63]UK Politics

   The Houses of Parliament at sunset Image copyright PA Image caption A
   new stage in the legislative process has been introduced to give
   English and Welsh MPs an effective veto over relevant laws

   The new system of "English Votes for English Laws" is overly
   complicated and may not last long, MPs have warned.

   The Public Administration Select Committee said the arrangement could
   end up as a "short term experiment" due to levels of opposition in the
   Commons.

   Legislation deemed to affect England, or England and Wales only, is now
   subject to an extra stage of scrutiny, involving only MPs elected
   there.

   Ministers said it was an "important balance" to devolution elsewhere.

   The rules, introduced in response to calls for a stronger voice for
   English MPs following increased devolution to Scotland, were activated
   in the House of Commons for the first time last month.

   English and Welsh MPs gave their consent to parts of the Housing and
   Planning Bill that only apply to their constituencies, as part of a new
   stage in the legislative process for considering bills applying only to
   their constituents.

'Ad hoc'

   In a report on the new system, the cross-party committee of MPs said
   there was "strong English demand" for measures to address the
   "constitutional anomalies" that devolution had brought.

   But it said the new provisions were "ad hoc", lacked transparency and
   appeared incompatible with the 40-year old Barnett Formula for
   distributing funds to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

   "The new standing orders do require further consideration and
   evaluation if they are to be anything more than a short-term experiment
   in the House's internal procedure," the MPs said.

   "That former clerks of the House of Commons - individuals steeped in
   decades of learning about Parliamentary procedure - should have
   difficulty in discerning what these standing orders mean should raise
   serious further doubts about how sustainable they are."

   The report said the test for whether legislation applied only to
   England, which is determined by the Commons Speaker, was not "very
   simple" and risked putting the Speaker in an "unnecessarily
   controversial position".

   The extent of the opposition to the system, which has united Labour,
   the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Democratic Unionist
   Party, "underlined their vulnerability", the committee said.

Review

   The SNP has said the changes are "driving Scotland out of the door".

   "With only the Conservative Party in favour of the new arrangements,
   these standing orders face a high risk of being overridden as soon as
   there is a non-Conservative majority in the House of Commons," it said.

   "That the standing orders have attracted such hostility and can be
   removed on the basis of a simple majority must raise doubts as to
   whether they can ever be more than a temporary expedient, and currently
   they cannot be considered to be part of a stable constitutional
   settlement that will endure."

   Tory MP Bernard Jenkin, who chairs the committee, said the new system
   had little cross-party support and urged ministers to come back with
   "more comprehensible proposals" during a review later this year.

   A government spokesman said: "The government is committed to a stronger
   Union and a fair settlement for the whole of the United Kingdom, and
   English votes for English laws brings an important balance to the
   unprecedented powers that have been devolved to other parts of the
   country.

   "We will be reviewing the operation of the standing orders later this
   year, drawing upon the work of both the Public Administration and
   Constitutional Affairs Committee and the House of Commons Procedure
   Committee."

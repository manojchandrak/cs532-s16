      Check out who else will be returning for the Gilmore Girls Netflix
      revival.

   Milo Ventimiglia, Matt Czuchry, Liza Weil and Yanic Truesdale are now all
   confirmed for the Gilmore Girls Netflix revival

      With the Gilmore Girls Netflix revival officially confirmed as
      of [30]late last month, the streaming service has today issued an
      update that confirms the return of several key Stars Hollow
      faces. [31]Milo Ventimiglia ([32]Gotham), Matt Czuchry (The Good Wife),
      Liza Weil (How To Get Away With Murder) and Yanic Truesdale (Rumours)
      are set to return to their original characters. It has also been
      confirmed that the Gilmore Girls Netflix revival will include four
      90-minute episodes. The series title and premiere date are to be
      confirmed at a later date.

      Previously announced cast members returning for the Gilmore Girls
      Netflix revival include Lauren Graham (Parenthood), Alexis Bledel (The
      Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants), Scott Patterson (Saw V), Kelly
      Bishop (The Good Wife), Keiko Agena (Transformers: Dark of the Moon)
      and Sean Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy). Series regulars missing from
      the revival include Edward Herrmann, who tragically passed away earlier
      this year, and Melissa McCarthy, whose stardom has soared since the
      series went off the air.

      Gilmore Girls, which aired between 2000 and 2007, is set in Stars
      Hollow, a storybook Connecticut town populated by an eclectic mix of
      dreamers, artists and everyday folk. The multi-generational drama about
      family and friendship centers around Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham)
      and her daughter, Rory (Alexis Bledel). Lorelai owns the town’s
      bed-and-breakfast, the Dragonfly Inn, with best friend/chef Sookie
      (Melissa McCarthy), and contends with weekly dinners with eccentric,
      well-off parents Richard (Edward Herrmann) and Emily Gilmore (Kelly
      Bishop), who always have something to say about their daughter’s life.

      Amy Sherman-Palladino is the creator and executive producer. Daniel
      Palladino is also an executive producer. They are both writing and
      directing the series. Gilmore Girls is produced by Dorothy Parker Drank
      Here Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television.

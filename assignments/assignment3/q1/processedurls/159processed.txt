More Great Obama Economic News Republicans Are Afraid Americans Will Hear

   2015 saw "the lowest number of bankruptcy filings for any 12-month
   period since 2007, and the fifth consecutive calendar year that filings
   have fallen significantly"

   More Great Obama Economic News Republicans Are Afraid Americans Will
   Hear

   As if there has been a dearth of good economic news, something
   Republicans certainly are getting weary of hearing, another
   media-ignored report shows again that under a Democratic
   Administration, the economy does better and steadily improves; for
   businesses and private Americans alike. Everyone has heard about the
   Obama Administration’s steady record of increase in jobs and decline in
   the unemployment rate; news that pains Republicans. But the
   conservatives take that news in stride because their control of
   Congress keeps robust economic improvement out of reach no matter how
   many jobs are created.

   A fair number of the millions of new jobs languish with a pathetically
   low minimum wage; something President Barack Obama has begged, prodded,
   and attempted to shame Republicans into raising. Still, with more
   people working and able to spend their hard-earned dollars, the economy
   is improving and a steady and drastic drop in the number of bankruptcy
   filings is more verifiable proof of Democratic superiority in handling
   the economy.

   Actually there are a couple of other factors driving the drastic 10
   percent drop in bankruptcy filings in 2015 besides job creation; more
   on that below. This latest decline was not a one-time economic anomaly
   because the previous four years also posted a steady decrease in both
   business and personal bankruptcy filings.  According to an annual
   [36]report released by the United States Courts, the federal entity
   administrating the nation’s business and personal financial failures,

   “During the 12-month period ending December 31, 2015, 844,495 cases
   were filed in federal bankruptcy courts, down from the 936,795
   bankruptcy cases filed in calendar year 2014—a 9.9 percent drop in
   filings. This is the lowest number of bankruptcy filings for any
   12-month period since 2007, and the fifth consecutive calendar year
   that filings have fallen significantly.”

   It is noteworthy that the end of 2007 marked the beginning of the
   catastrophic Republican-created Great Recession that bankrupted
   millions of private citizens and decimated thousands of businesses and
   millions of jobs. Corporations generally are protected from
   death-by-bankruptcy through special interest rules regarding
   ‘reorganization’ and selling off debt and operations to overseas
   entities for a profit. Private citizens have no such protection, but
   between the two-year Democratic majority in Congress and President
   Obama’s guidance, Americans and businesses are going broke and losing
   everything much less often.

   The U.S. Courts’ report is yet another signal to Americans that no
   matter how disastrous Republican economic policies for the economy,
   only Democrats have answers to remedy the problem; federal government
   intervention via banking and financial regulations and laws to protect
   consumers. They are two things Republicans claim are economy killers,
   and because Republicans parrot the same exact claim about raising the
   minimum wage, something President Obama has called for over the past
   seven years, Americans should consider how much better the economy
   would be if the Republican Congress raised wages the people would
   inject back into the economy and spur greater growth.

   One of the reasons there were fewer business and personal bankruptcy
   filings over the past five years was the Democrats’ Dodd-Frank
   financial reform law; the reform Republicans lust to abolish in its
   entirety. One of the facets of Dodd-Frank was reining in banks and
   financial institutions making bad loans to people who could hardly
   afford to buy a home. Real estate brokers and agents often complain
   that due to the financial reform law, they are unable to move poor
   people into homes, and crushing mortgages, they could never afford.
   Just that part of the reform is a major factor in both declining home
   mortgage defaults and bankruptcy filings.

   The other major factor in far fewer bankruptcies is due to the
   President’s Affordable Care Act that protects Americans from losing
   everything due to a catastrophic health issue or injury. It is not
   because Americans are any healthier than before 2011, but millions more
   Americans do have health care coverage due to the Affordable Care Act.
   With regular health checkups, what may be a disastrous health issue can
   be caught and dealt with before they become catastrophic.

   Even Americans who did have healthcare insurance prior to the ACA’s
   passage were subjected to lifetime limits on care and the hideous
   “preexisting condition” scam that bankrupted sick or injured Americans
   regularly.

   The so-called “Obamacare” that Republicans have attempted to abolish
   over 60 times in Congress and twice in the nation’s highest court has
   contributed to the nation’s declining bankruptcy filings, much more
   than even Democrats are inclined to boast about. That health insurance
   reform law that Republicans and 53 percent of Americans hate is a major
   factor in why fewer American families are losing everything they have
   and it is something Republicans do not want Americans to know.

   One understands why Republicans and their considerable media force will
   never cite the health law’s economic impact as far as preventing
   Americans from losing everything and going bankrupt because they were
   sick, but it is curious that Democrats are staying quiet; particularly
   in the poor Republican-dominated Southern states and especially during
   the lead up to a general election.

   Although the economy can continue improving if the
   Republican-controlled Congress would work for the good of the people
   and raise the minimum wage, and by extension the economy, there is
   little hope they will have a change of heart. That is one of the
   adverse effects of Democrats staying home and not voting in 2010; they
   virtually assured there would be no congressional help for underpaid
   workers for at least a decade; no matter who is president.

   Still, the lesson for Americans is that in less than two years of a
   Democratic Administration and less-than progressive
   Democratic-controlled Congress, one necessary financial reform law and
   one embattled healthcare insurance reform have improved the economy and
   produced the steady, five year decline in the number of Americans and
   businesses losing everything they have in the world and going bankrupt;
   something Democrats should be shouting from the rooftops and a
   statistic Republicans do not want anyone to hear.

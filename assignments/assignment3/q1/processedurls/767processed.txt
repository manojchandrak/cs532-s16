   Whats-the-Latest-in-Social-Media-News-Looks-Like-the-10000-Character-Li
   mit-on-Twitter-May-Become-Reality

   I thought I’d try something new and give you guys the inside scoop on
   some social media breaking news! I always try to stay on top of what’s
   going on and love to let you all know what is going on too.

So here’s the latest social media news:

1. 10,000 Character Limit on Twitter Looks to Be Happening

   Last weekend I was in San Francisco for Periscope Community Summit and
   got to cross something off of my bucket list at the same time…VISIT
   TWITTER HEADQUARTERS!

   IFRAME:
   [38]https://katch.me/embed/v/ae8ceba1-e8b8-36d5-9816-b7f89939a4d5?sync=
   1

   They have an amazing office and a really great company culture, but you
   know what? I couldn’t resist asking about the 10,000-character limit
   that has been all the buzz lately. In case you haven’t heard, there has
   been a lot of rumors floating around that [39]Twitter is going to
   increase the number of characters available for tweets from 140 to
   10,000! WHAT? I was at Twitter headquarters so why not ask, right? So I
   said…”hey Jose, what do you think…is this going to happen? While he
   didn’t confirm it totally, he did say that he thought it would happen.
   GROAN, right?

   BUT no need to panic! While this seems like a big move for Twitter they
   have actually done a lot of backend research and found that even when
   given the really high character limits on some of the other social
   media platforms, most users don’t come close to using even a fraction
   of them. Twitter found that the average social media user only writes a
   sentence for two, which is pretty much the same 140 character count
   they currently have.

   I also speculate that they will do something similar to Facebook’s
   “read more” when users write more than 140 character tweets.

   This is an interesting shift for Twitter and we’ll see how it all
   shakes out, but I don’t think we will really see a big change in the
   long run. Fingers crossed of course!

2. Periscope Videos Can Now Be Seen LIVE in Your Twitter Feed!

   Have you seen [40]Periscope videos popping up in your Twitter feed yet?
   Periscope and Twitter announced that instead of scopes showing up as
   just a link they will start rolling out the ability to see a live scope
   inside of your feed.

     Periscope broadcasts now come alive within Twitter
     [41]https://t.co/R346R1lgZb

     — Periscope (@periscopeco) [42]January 12, 2016

   The caveat to that is this new feature is only available on the iOS
   Twitter app only as of right now, but they did say Android and web
   users can expect to start seeing the live videos as soon as the feature
   is ready on the platforms.

   What does this mean for YOU? It means that you can really start
   attracting followers to your scopes by showing interesting content that
   catches their attention on Twitter. This also means that key hashtags
   are more important than ever so your content can be found and you can
   leverage both platforms to grow your tribe.

3. Facebook Mentions is Now Available on Android

   While you still need a blue verified badge on your Fan Page in order to
   get access to the [43]Facebook Mentions app, Android users with the
   badge should be jumping for joy because Facebook has now released the
   app on [44]Google Play!

   FB_Mentions

   You may have heard that Facebook recently started rolling out the
   Facebook Live feature to personal pages not too long ago. I have heard
   that they are adding about 500 profiles a day to the list of users with
   access.

   However, please remember that per [45]Facebook’s TOS, you are not
   allowed to use your personal profile for business purposes. You want to
   be careful how you use the Live feature from your profile if you are
   one of the few who has access.

   I’m sure at some point they will start rolling out Live to Fan Pages
   that aren’t verified. We’ll just have to wait and see when that will
   be.

4. WhatsApp May Soon Be Opening Up to Businesses

   WhatsApp is nearing its 100 million users mark and it looks like some
   changes are in the works.

   After Facebook bought the messaging app in 2014 it was always the plan
   to start finding ways for the app to begin making some revenue and it
   seems like that revenue may be coming from [46]businesses interested in
   joining the app.

   whatsapp

   Certain businesses like BBC and restaurants in Hong Kong have already
   found ways to use the app in very cool and unique ways like helping to
   deliver news tips or reserving a table.

   Seems like there are definitely some opportunities here.

5. Pay Attention to Snapchat

   All I have been hearing lately is how [47]Snapchat is the place you
   need to be.

   Some [48]big name brands like McDonald’s, Taco Bell, General Electric
   are already finding ways to use Snapchat to reach its mostly millennial
   market and having some great successes.

     On Snapchat? Follow [49]@generalelectric for all things geeky & get
     an exclusive transmission from Buzz Aldrin tomorrow!

   I would recommend checking into Snapchat if you think your target
   market is there. With 100 million daily active users it might be a
   fantastic fit for your business.

   There ya go! My top five social media news stories! Like I said, I
   always love to keep current on what’s happening and share what I find
   with YOU.

   Are there any other social media news stories you have heard lately
   that we should know about? I’d love to hear about them below!

       Is Twitter Bringing out Much Needed Features:
       1. Edit Tweets
       2. 140 Character Limit (That Shows) should include Only Text.
       Links, Photos, Hashtags (1-2), @Mentions should NOT be considered.
       3. Tagging People in Photos – For Web (PC) Users — [My Choice]
       Thank You.

       I keep hearing about Snapchat and how it is the next big thing. I
       did secure my user name just so no one else does but am not sure
       what exactly the platform is. I think it is video which is not
       something I am interested in. Like many I am sort of camera shy
       like that.
       I guess I will look into it yet on the other hand I get bummed how
       everything evolves and as soon as I figure it out something new
       comes along and…well…remember MySpace?
       Look what Troy S. just posted..[62]#819 Hello Kitty hot chocolate

   Mortgage Rates Inch Further Into 1-Year Lows
   Feb 10 2016, 5:28PM

   [162]Mortgage rates barely budged today, but did manage to gain just a
   bit of ground.  That means another 1-year low, technically, although
   many lenders are quoting the exact some conventional 30yr fixed rates
   as yesterday.  The range is currently between 3.5% and 3.625% with most
   lenders still at the higher boundary.

   Investors were anxious to hear how Fed Chair Yellen would convey the
   Fed's current gameplan in light of recent market movements.
   Specifically, markets are forecasting no rate hikes in 2016 while Fed
   speakers have generally indicated there would be more like 4 hikes.
   Yellen did a good job of not getting too specific on that topic, only
   saying that the Fed wouldn't rush to change its stance based on one
   crazy month of market volatility, but would, of course, consider a
   balance of data and events in adjusting its policy.

   It wouldn't have made too much sense for Yellen to lean too far in
   either direction on that topic.  If she said "yeah, we're freaked out
   and definitely not going to hike 4 times now," markets would have
   freaked out with her due to the lack of confidence that would convey.
   If she'd taken the opposite path and promised 4 rate hikes no matter
   what, markets would have freaked out because investors wouldn't think
   the global economy could handle such a thing.

   In essence, she abstained, and markets reacted accordingly, with stocks
   and bonds continuing to show their acceptance of the early 2016
   movement.

   Loan Originator Perspective

   "Bonds and equities both rallied mildly today, after Chairwoman Yellen
   testified to Congress. Some lenders posted improved pricing mid day,
   but for most, the gains weren't sufficient to recall rates. The long
   term trend to lower rates is intact, the question is when it pauses. I
   locked a couple of loans within 30 days of closing, but floating
   remains a valid option for those with time, and risk tolerance on their
   side." -Ted Rood, Senior Originator

   "Despite a little pull back this morning, rates are managing to hold
   onto the recent gains.  With the quick move over the last few days,
   lenders have been patient in passing along the gains.   The longer we
   hold here, the more lenders can pass along.  Due to the small pull back
   this morning, I would float over night and evaluate pricing in the
   morning." -Victor Burek, Churchill Mortgage

   Today's Best-Execution Rates
     * 30YR FIXED - 3.625
     * FHA/VA - 3.5%
     * 15 YEAR FIXED - 3.125
     * 5 YEAR ARMS -  2.75 - 3.25% depending on the lender

   Ongoing Lock/Float Considerations
     * The Fed finally hiked on December 16th, causing fears of rising
       rates in 2016.

     * But  global financial markets came into the new year in
       distress.  Now markets aren't even convinced that we'll see another
       Fed rate hike in 2016.  Major stock indices plummeted around the
       world, and investors sought shelter in the bond market.  When
       investor demand for bonds increases, rates fall.
     * So we're left with much lower mortgage rates despite the Fed having
       just begun its hiking cycle.  This paradoxical trend can continue
       as long as global market turmoil fuels a demand for safer haven
       investments.  A big bounce in oil/stock prices could mean trouble
       for rates--at least temporarily.
     * As always, please keep in mind that the rates discussed generally
       refer to what we've termed '[163]best-execution' (that is, the most
       frequently quoted, conforming, conventional 30yr fixed rate for top
       tier borrowers, based not only on the outright price, but also
       'bang-for-the-buck.'  Generally speaking, our best-execution rate
       tends to connote no origination or discount points--though this can
       vary--and tends to predict Freddie Mac's weekly survey with high
       accuracy.  It's safe to assume that our best-ex rate is the more
       timely and accurate of the two due to Freddie's once-a-week polling
       method).

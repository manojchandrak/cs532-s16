       Malaysia Airlines said on July 17 that it had "lost contact" with
       one of its passenger planes whose last known position was over
       eastern Ukraine, amid speculation it had been shot down. "Malaysia
       Airlines has lost contact of MH17 from Amsterdam," the airline,
       still reeling from the disappearance of flight MH370, said on its
       Twitter account. The plane was due to travel from Amsterdam on an
       overnight flight to Kuala Lumpur, and was expected in the Malaysian
       capital at around 6:00 am on Friday (2200 GMT Thursday). Ukrainian

   These beautiful portraits reveal the incredibly human-like expressions
   of a variety of apes, showing how closely related we truly are.

   The intimate photographs show a wide range of monkey species, including
   bonobos, gorillas, orangutans and chimps, looking angry, sad, delighted
   and pensive.

   The many apes were photographed predominantly at zoos across Austria,
   Belgium, the Czech Republic, [68]Germany and the Netherlands.

   They are the works of Manuela Kulpa, from Cologne, Germany, who spent
   years photographing the animals.

   Ms Kulpa, 45, said: 'Emotions like our own are mirrored in the faces of
   the apes - you really can believe what you see in their faces.

   'They are happy, tender, mischievous, insulted, thoughtful, angry,
   helpless, shy, bashful, sad and so on.

   'In their eyes - if they grant us to take a deep look - you can find an
   odd mix of youth and age, light-heartedness and deep wisdom.

   'What is it that they know and we don't?'

   Ms Kulpa shot the unique series over a number of years, but only
   recently released the images to tie in with the Chinese New Year, the
   Year of the Monkey.

   The photographer has been shooting with her husband, Stefan, for the
   past eight years, and admits she has always been fascinated by
   wildlife.

   As well as her ape project, Ms Kulpa has worked on shoots with the
   likes of birds, dogs, big cats and elephants.

   Her favourite animals to shoot are simians and big cats, and through
   such images she hopes to show viewers the importance and beauty of
   nature.

   She added: 'My love for animals has grown very much over the years
   through photography.

       their Tight Pants to The Tonight Show. Will Ferrell returned to the
       late night chat show with a new rendition of the classic Tight
       Pants sketch. Appearing in the mop-top wig and form-fitting white
       trousers, the familiar melody soon hits finding Ferrell doing the
       twist and singing. "Everybody's lookin' at my tight pants," Ferrell
       sings and after a beat, he's joined by Christina Aguilera who adds
       a nice harmony to the performance. The two celebrate the tightness
       of their pants but when host Jimmy Fallon joins the circle, things
       take a dark turn. After a brief moment, it looks like Fallon is
       encroaching on their space and soon the question of Aguilera's
       fidelity - she plays Ferrell's wife in the skit - comes into play.
       The question of paternity soon passes as the Fallon exits the
       segment, leaving everyone to imagine how a baby can be 'swaddled in
       the tightest of pants' 'Everybody's talking bout my tight pants!'

Cudlitz's 'Walking Dead' 'Stache Has Its Own Twitter Account

   On "The Walking Dead," Michael Cudlitz's character, Abraham Ford, is
   known for his bright red hair and distinctive Fu Manchu-like mustache.

   His facial hair has so captivated fans of the zombie apocalypse drama
   that they've even created an off-color [101]Twitter account for it at
   @CudlitzStache

   "They play with it and they play with the fact that we don't
   acknowledge it," Cudlitz said in an interview this week. "It's like,
   'What are you doing? I'm right here. I'm right under your nose.'"

   Cudlitz said he usually doesn't comment on the Twitter page because he
   doesn't want to get in the way of fans having fun. But sometimes he
   just can't resist and will chime in with something like, "'Hey, knock
   it off,' or I say, 'I'm going to cut you off,'" adding that "everybody
   gets nervous when you say something like that."

   He spoke just days before "The Walking Dead" returns with its midseason
   premiere Feb. 14 on AMC at 9 p.m. ET.

   Cudlitz said Season 6 picks up with Alexandria overrun with zombies.

   "This is the ultimate test," Cudlitz said, of whether the new
   characters in the town have the mettle to survive. "In this episode
   we'll see who is able to rise to the occasion and who gets crushed by
   it."

   Fans also get to meet Negan, the iconic villain of the comic books the
   series is based on, played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan.

   "You're going to love Negan. You're going to love to hate Negan and
   that's what I think the show needs, someone that you love that is bad
   that is just as beloved as the characters that he's trying to kill."

   As for Abraham, having found a way to move beyond his malaise, he's now
   feeling a bit frisky, which viewers saw when he hit on fellow survivor
   Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green), even though he's already having an affair
   with Rosita (Christian Serratos).

   Cudlitz said he doesn't see anything wrong with that.

   "It's the zombie apocalypse. He's human."

   With our Triathlete Fit contest, we’re recognizing the hard work and
   dedication that goes into becoming your fittest, healthiest self. We
   put to vote 40 submissions that we hope inspired triathletes looking to
   achieve their own fitness goals in 2016.

   We’re excited to announce our winners, Dean “Dino” Bruno and Dana
   Dambrauskas. Both will be flown to Triathlete HQ in San Diego for a
   photo shoot and will be featured in a future issue of Triathlete
   magazine.

   Thank you to all of the triathletes who shared their images and stories
   with us. In total, we received more than 150,000 votes. Special thanks
   to our contest partner, De Soto Sport.

   Get to know Dino and Dana from their entries below.

Dean “Dino” Bruno

   I became hooked on physical fitness when I ran the Long Island Marathon
   in May of 1994. I suffered late in the race from warm conditions, going
   out too fast and bonked, but completed the race in 4 hours 15 minutes
   and change. Ever since that day, I’ve been aggressive in my quest to be
   faster and in better physical condition. In February 2010, while
   training for the Boston Marathon I felt exhausted and physically spent.
   Thinking that I overtrained, I cancelled running Boston and decreased
   my training volume. That May, I was diagnosed with stage three
   Hodgkin’s lymphoma. After six months of chemotherapy, I was in
   remission. Subsequently, I ran three marathons but post-chemotherapy
   fatigue was high and my times slower than in the past. I hired a
   USAT-certified triathlon coach in March 2014 who taught me how to swim,
   modified my diet to Paleo, made me into a 2015 Ironman Lake Placid
   finisher and trained me in re‐qualifying for and running in my 25th
   overall marathon in Boston this upcoming April. I’m in the best shape
   of my life physically and mentally due to triathlon, and have gained
   new friendships in training with others who have similar aspirations.

Dana Dambrauskas

   Triathlon has helped me reach my goal of looking fit and feeling good
   at 40 years old. This photo is part of a gift from my closest friends.
   On my birthday they honored my dedication to the triathlon lifestyle by
   booking a “Turning 40 and Looking Fit Photo Shoot.” My friends
   recognized my commitment to the lifestyle and honored me with an
   opportunity to flaunt my physique and some cool gear. This picture
   symbolizes hard work, dedication and love of sport.

   Living a balanced lifestyle of triathlon training, work, family and fun
   has been the key to my long-term success with looking fit at 40. Goal
   setting helps keep focus when life gets busy. Belonging to a triathlon
   team and staying involved with local clubs helps to keep the motivation
   going. The memories created on the journey to race day are worth the
   early morning wake up calls.

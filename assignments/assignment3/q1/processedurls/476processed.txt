   [47]Greg Hunt

Reuters distances itself from Greg Hunt 'best minister' award: 'It wasn't our
idea'

   Confusion surrounds the process by which Australia’s environment
   minister was crowned the world’s No 1, with the news agency denying it
   designed the scheme

   Greg Hunt was ‘genuinely humbled’ to receive the best minister award
   but his explanation of the selection process has been called into
   question.

   Confusion surrounds the selection process for the “best minister in the
   world” award [56]bestowed upon Greg Hunt at the World Government Summit
   in Dubai for his efforts to reduce carbon emissions.

   [57]According to the summit’s website in the United Arab Emirates, the
   “best minister in the world” award was “thoroughly and independently
   managed by Thomson Reuters where the search for the nominees is
   conducted according to the established criteria”.

   world

   According to a radio interview by the “humbled” Hunt, the award was
   also initiated by Reuters.

   “Reuters news agency said to the UAE government that they’d like to
   create the award and present it at the World Government Summit,” the
   federal environment minister said.

   “They then commissioned the World Bank, the OECD, Ernst & Young and an
   international strategic firm called Strategy and Co to draw up a list
   of 100 – they then winnowed it down to 10. They used a series of
   criteria, they had a voting program – and we didn’t know about it, and
   I got a call just over a week ago.”

   But [59]Thomson Reuters said it was “not correct” to say that the
   company initiated the award or were responsible for designing the
   selection process.

   “Thomson Reuters was solely responsible for assisting in the
   administration of the award, to a set of criteria approved by the World
   Government Summit organisers,” said Tarek Fleihan, head of corporate
   communications for the financial information company in the Middle
   East, Africa and Russia.

   Thomson Reuters promised a full clarifying statement, but has not yet
   issued one. Reuters news said it had no involvement in the process.

   Accepting the award at the summit, Hunt said that “on a personal level
   I am genuinely humbled to receive this award. I am, however, deeply
   proud that this inaugural award is being presented to an environment
   minister.”

   In an interview with Fairfax Media, [60]Hunt described his win as
   “really an award for Australia” and reassured readers that his wife had
   insisted he “still had to put the bins out”.

   The website says there were nominations from 80 countries, which were
   assessed based on four criteria:
     * Innovation and leadership: the solution that was introduced by the
       candidate will have revolutionised the utilisation of government
       services by its citizens. This work of true innovation will have
       increased productivity, reduced costs and improve the citizen’s
       opinion of the government.
     * Quality and impact: the solution should address the needs of the
       citizens and must demonstrate a significant social impact.
       Significant social impact includes but is not limited to easily
       accessible government services for all citizens, efficiency in
       execution, human development impact, job creation, etc.
     * Replication: the solution must have the quality of being easily
       replicated in multiple geographies. The solution should demonstrate
       propensity for impact beyond the local level, either nationally,
       regionally or globally.
     * Reputation: the candidate must be highly credible amongst his peers
       and the general public. The candidate must have a proven record
       amongst his peers of developing innovative solutions that have
       positively impacted the citizens.

   “The aim of this award is to recognise innovation in global government
   work and highlight ministerial initiatives that have resulted in
   positive changes in their communities,” the UAE minister of cabinet
   affairs, Mohammed Al Gergawi, told the summit as he gave Hunt the
   award.

   “Our world today needs ministers to serve as role models of thought and
   action, which bring about progress and welfare and improve general
   societal wellbeing.”

   Official statistics [61]released in December revealed Australia’s
   greenhouse gas emissions increased in the year to the end of June 2015
   by 0.8% and by 1.3% when land use and deforestation were taken into
   account.

   On Wednesday the Greens deputy leader, Scott Ludlam, attacked Hunt’s
   “brazen audacity” over accepting the “best minister in the world”
   award.

   In a satirical address to the nation, Ludlam said while the award
   “might sound like something his mum made up ... on behalf of the
   Australian Greens I am asking you to join me in calling on Prime
   Minister Malcolm Turnbull to declare February the 10th a public holiday
   to mark this unique occasion”.

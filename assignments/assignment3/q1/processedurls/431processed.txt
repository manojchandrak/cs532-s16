Senate Approves Harsh Sanctions on North Korea

The unanimous vote comes after Pyongyang tested a long-range rocket over the
weekend.

   People watch a television screen showing a breaking news on North
   Korea's long-range rocket launch at Seoul Station, on Feb. 7, 2016 in
   Seoul, South Korea.

   The Senate on Wednesday unanimously approved a fresh set of sanctions
   to punish North Korea just days after its launch of a long-range
   rocket.

   The bill, which passed on a 96-0 vote, was similar to one passed by the
   House last month after Pyongyang tested a nuclear device. It received
   overwhelming bipartisan support from a Congress that has criticized the
   Obama administration for not doing enough to reprimand North Korea.

   Both actions violate U.N. sanctions against the isolated regime of
   dictator Kim Jong Un, who has consistently flouted international
   efforts to curb his country's nuclear activities. The U.S. already
   sanctions North Korea, but the legislation places new punishment on the
   regime to target individuals involved in its nuclear program and its
   human rights abuses.

   "North Korea poses a serious and growing threat to its neighbors, our
   allies South Korea, Japan, others. It poses a threat to our homeland,
   the United States and to global security," said Sen. Cory Gardner,
   R-Colo., the bill's coauthor. "While the threat is growing, our
   policies are failing to deter the forgotten maniac in Pyongyang, Kim
   Jong Un."

   The Obama administration hasn't publicly said whether or not the
   president would sign the legislation.

Inside North Korea

   The international community has struggled to restrict North Korea's
   mercurial ruler. The U.S. and China have publicly sparred over the
   handling of the rogue regime. China, Pyongyang's key international
   backer, has been hesitant to push back too hard against Kim's recent
   activities for fear harsh sanctions could destabilize North Korea that
   could lead to an influx of refugees into China.

   The U.N. condemned both January's nuclear test, which Pyongyang claims
   was of a hydrogen bomb but the West believes was a less-sophisticated
   weapon, and Sunday's launch of a satellite officials said used
   ballistic missile components. Beijing urged North Korea not to go
   through with its threat to launch the satellite, a warning that went
   unheeded, but the U.N. Security Council has not passed additional
   sanctions against Pyongyang for its activity.

   Gardner called the U.N. delay in action "disturbing."

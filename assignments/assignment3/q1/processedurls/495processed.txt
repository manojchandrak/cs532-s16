   Vermin Supreme outside a Rand Paul campaign event in Milford, New
   Hampshire, last year.

   Pony-loving, boot wearing Vermin Supreme finished fourth among
   Democrats in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary.

   Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton in a rout. Martin O'Malley, who
   dropped out of the race after the Iowa Caucus, finished a distant
   third.

   But the fourth place finisher was a name familiar to many New Hampshire
   voters: Massachusetts resident Vermin Supreme, the perennial candidate
   best known for his campaign platform to provide[70] free ponies to
   every American.

   [71]With 96 percent of precincts reporting, Supreme received 257 votes,
   only slightly less than half of the 622 votes O'Malley received. That's
   also more than Republicans Mike Huckabee (214), Rick Santorum (197),
   Jim Gilmore (132), George Pataki (79) and Bobby Jindal (50) tallied. In
   their defense, though, all but Gilmore had already dropped out of the
   race.

   With his large beard and boot hat, Supreme has become somewhat of a
   cult figure in New Hampshire, where he spent a great deal of time
   attending candidate events and handing out candy. He was banned from
   the annual "Lesser Known Candidates Forum" at Saint Anselm College this
   year after he famously [73]glitter-bombed the event four years ago,
   causing a mess that proved costly for the college to clean up.

   He also hosted a giant party and concert over Labor Day weekend.
   [74]"Burning Vermin: Vermin Supreme Labor Day Telethon Money Bomb," was
   held at a farm in Croydon, New Hampshire, and featured a pig roast,
   bands and readings by Supreme.

   The joke's on all of usâ€”[30]Kim Kardashian has had a Snapchat this
   whole time!

   Don't beat yourself up, though, nobody knew about her secret social
   media account until she revealed the news earlier today on longtime
   friend Jonathan Cheban's Snapchat story. While [31]in New York City
   with Cheban, her pal called her out for not making it clear on who put
   her on the whole Snapchat game long time ago, which led to Kim sharing
   a very interesting story.

   "I'll talk fast, OK, I didn't know Snapchat was only 15 seconds," Kim
   began. "So I was bored in London. I couldn't sleep. And then Jonathan
   had me open up a secret Snap. Do you wanna know why?"

   [32]LOOK: You can see Jonathan Cheban Snapchatting Kim in this picture

   Splash News

   Obvs, Kim, do tell..."Jonathan told me that if I followed some of our
   friends and saw what they really do in their real life, wasted and
   acting so crazy, I would never be friends with them again."

   Ooooh, sneaky. "So Jonathan walked me through how to open up a Snapchat
   in London. [33]Kanye West was snoring in the bed right next to me, not
   really snoring, passed out. I couldn't sleep so Jonathan opened up a
   Snapchat with me over the phone and I started following some friends
   and saw what they do in their..."

   Damn the timer on those Snapchat videos, but we're going to guess the
   next words were "everyday lives."

   Ultimately, Kim explains that she's been on the Snap, but didn't tell
   anybody because her sole purpose of being on there was a top secret
   mission. "So, Jonathan is the reason I have a secret Snap and I only
   lurk and stalk people." LOL! Fair.

   However, perhaps the brunette beauty will decide to openly Snapchat
   with fans, soon? She recently sparked some speculation that she'd be
   joining in on all of the fun when she [34]posted a video of herself
   playing with the "I [heart] U" selfie filter.

   And as we already know, those selfie filters will get ya.

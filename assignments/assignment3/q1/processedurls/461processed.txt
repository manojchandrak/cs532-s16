Mild winter gives 2016 housing market a jump-start

   [36]Buying [37]News
   [38]comment

   Pending sales in January were way up from a year ago, though prices
   remained flat.  [39][[SLIDE]]
   Jessica Rinaldi/Boston Globe

By Scott Van Voorhis

   Boston.com Correspondent
   February 9, 2016 3:13 PM

   A relatively mild start to winter dramatically boosted home sales
   activity as buyers took advantage of the spring-like temps to hit open
   houses and make offers.

   The number of pending sales—where homes have been put under agreement,
   but have not yet officially closed – rose nearly 40 percent in January
   compared to the same month a year ago, the Massachusetts Association of
   Realtors (MAR) reports.

   It was a sharp contrast with last winter’s epic arctic weather and
   never ending blizzards, which sent pending sales last January
   plummeting 16 percent while effectively burying the spring sales market
   under several feet of snow.

   With the exception of last January, pending sales have been up every
   month for nearly three years now, the realtors group notes.

   Even as sales shot up this January, prices remained relatively flat,
   edging up .1 percent to $330,000.

   Pending condo sales were also up as well, rising 34 percent, with the
   median condo price edging down .8 percent to $309,438, MAR reports.

   Increasing confidence

   “Buyers were again out in force in January and were able to take
   advantage of the mild weather to see homes and make a high number of
   offers that were accepted in January,” said 2016 MAR President Annie
   Blatz, branch executive at Kinlin Grover Real Estate on Cape Cod, in a
   press statement.

   “A still improving economy and an increase in first-time homebuyers in
   Massachusetts added to the buyer demand,” she said.

   Real estate brokers are experiencing growing confidence in the overall
   market, though less so with the direction of prices.

   MAR’s Market and Price Confidence Indexes show a 6 percent increase in
   market confidence, to 66.9, but pricing confidence remaining
   essentially flat at 73.58. The indexes are on a 100 point scale, with
   50 the midpoint between a weak market (0) and a strong market, 100.

   Smart homes making ripples

   Meanwhile, real estate brokers are also increasingly selling homes with
   “smart home” features, according to a poll by MAR of its members.

   A little below 40 percent of Realtors polled said they had listed a
   home with smart home features that included “thermostats, security
   systems and lighting that are controllable by an internet-connected
   device,” according to the survey.

   A very small number, 2 percent, said most of the homes they listed had
   smart home features, while the majority, 58 percent, said the haven’t
   seen any smart home gadgets in the homes they are selling.

   “These smart home devices are still relatively new to the marketplace,
   but are starting to increase in popularity here in Massachusetts,”
   Blatz noted. “It’s a good bet that we will see their use rise as more
   people see the benefits.”

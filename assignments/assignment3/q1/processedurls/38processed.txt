   [29]Demi Lovato is "confident" there's no diamond ring on her finger—at
   least not yet.

   Despite dating her boyfriend, actor [30]Wilmer Valderrama, for around
   five years, she can confirm she's not an engaged lady, though she's not
   opposed to the idea.

   "I don't see a ring," she told [31]Ellen DeGeneres when the talk show
   host inquired about circulating rumors. "I wouldn't mind if I saw one,
   but there's time for everything."

   Don't start sweating just yet, Wilmer—your lady is here to stay.

   "We've been together this long..obviously I'm not going anywhere," she
   joked.

   Birthday With a Wolfpack

   IFRAME: [33]//widgets.ellentube.com/videos/0-0jzjcexd/

   The 23-year-old singer isn't joking. She's had her eyes set on the That
   '70s Show star since she was just a teenager.

   "I met him six years ago. We were friends at first—I mean, I was head
   over heels and he was like, 'Stay away until you're old enough,'" she
   recollected.

   Now a full-fledged award-winning performer, the notion of marriage is
   not so far off. After all, these lovebirds spend seemingly every free
   moment together, from [34]packing on the PDA in St. Barts to throwing
   her man a [35]unique birthday celebration among a pack of wolves. This
   couple is crazy about each other and they're not shy about showing it.

   "Look at how handsome he is! He's so handsome," she gushed to DeGeneres
   while gazing at a black and white photo of her beau on the show.

   Valderrama regularly returns his lady's sentiments while gushing over
   his girlfriend on his Instagram account.

   "You inspire millions, and I'm one of them," he wrote to commemorate
   her [36]23rd birthday. "Your smile keeps getting bigger and bigger with
   every birthday that comes by! I'm blessed to see it shine."

   Perhaps one day we'll see a nice diamond on her finger also shining.

   By ANTHONY McCARTNEY, AP Entertainment Writer

   LOS ANGELES (AP) — An Ohio man charged with stalking Gwyneth Paltrow
   testified Wednesday that he sent her dozens of messages in the hope she
   might want to marry him despite her testifying against him in a
   previous stalking case.

   Dante Soiu testified that he wanted his messages to show her
   unconditional love and friendship and that he had no animosity toward
   her over the earlier case, which sent him to a mental institution for
   several years. That case involved 500 messages, including sex toys and
   pornography, Soiu sent Paltrow in 1999 and 2000.

   Soiu told jurors he wanted to let Paltrow know he was available and
   willing to marry her if the opportunity arose. His lawyers called him
   to testify in his own defense in the felony stalking case.

   He sent Paltrow 66 messages and packages between 2009 and 2015, but
   none of the recent correspondence included pornography. A judge has
   said the earlier messages could be important to understanding Paltrow's
   fear of Soiu.

   Paltrow testified Monday she was afraid of Soiu and began crying when
   she expressed fears about her children's safety.

   Deputy District Attorney Wendy Segall questioned why Paltrow would want
   to marry him after he had sent her so many lewd messages and she had to
   testify against him.

   "I was trying to show I had changed and I had become a different
   person," Soiu said. "I wanted to show a new face towards her."

   Soiu said he didn't want to scare the actress, but he was intent on her
   responding to him. "I wanted her to say flat out, 'I don't want to
   marry you,' " he said. "That way I would have a definite response from
   her."

   He said he wrote to many public figures, including President Barack
   Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian President
   Vladimir Putin offering counsel on world affairs and solutions to
   problems.

   He conceded that his notes to Paltrow were the only ones that expressed
   an interest in marriage. "Oh, no, I don't want to marry Putin," Soiu
   said.

   Soiu was found not guilty by reason of insanity in 2000 in the previous
   case involving pornographic messages he sent to Paltrow. He was
   re-arrested last year after sending the actress new correspondence.

   He said he was addicted to pornography at the time but said he is now
   on medication and considers himself healed.

   The recent batch of letters described Soiu's intention to marry the
   actress as well as a pair of earrings he sent her in 2009 as a
   Christmas gift, some secondhand clothes and a Weight Watchers cookbook.
   He has also sent her religious books, and forwarded her letters he has
   sent to President Barack Obama and actress Angelina Jolie.

   One letter described Paltrow "bowing to death," a reference the actress
   said she found disturbing.

   Soiu, a self-described born again Christian from Columbus, Ohio, said
   he was referencing spiritual, not physical death, in his letters.

   He said he hoped the Oscar winner would write him back if she wanted
   him to stop. "I wanted her to at least be a pen pal or at least say
   something," Soiu said.

   Soiu testified he believed he had an understanding with Paltrow's
   lawyer that he could write to the actress until he was told to stop. He
   conceded that he never spoke or corresponded with the lawyer to reach
   that agreement.

!llmind Hits The Studio With Black Thought & Royce Da 5'9

   !llmind Hits The Studio With Black Thought & Royce Da 5'9
   [31]5

   On Monday night (February 8) in The City That Never Sleeps, two lyrical
   titans occupied the same recording studio for what may turn out to be a
   monumental event.

   !llmind took to his Facebook page to share photos of a studio session
   he conducted with Black Thought of the Legendary Roots Crew and Royce
   Da 5'9.

   "Last night I had a session with [two] of the best to ever do it," the
   NYC beatsmith exclaimed. "Royce Da 5'9 and Black Thought from the
   Roots. Honored to say the least. Always a pleasure working with Royce.
   Black Thought just has an energy to him. Amazing person and just so
   damn good at what he does. They're both pros at the top of their game.
   Inspiring to just be around them. We're cooking something special and I
   can't wait for the world to hear it."

   The two revered rappers recently collaborated on the song "Wishin' II,"
   which is featured on the [32]PRhyme deluxe reissue album.

   !llmind has been particularly busy on the musically front himself.
   Following his executive role on [33]Hoodie Allen's latest album, he
   recently announced his upcoming EP, [34]Four Three Two, a
   disco-inspired project that utilizes the instruments and sounds that
   were prevelant through much of popular 70s music.

   "[Two] years ago, I rented a bunch of vintage synthesizers," he said,
   While in the studio, I was inspired and decided to create some disco
   inspired music. My parents used to have all this disco vinyl and I was
   always into that funk. That tempo. I sat on the project for 2 years and
   now it's time to unleash it. The EP is called Four Three Two and it's
   coming out on 2/19/16 via my imprint Roseville Music Group. I'm really
   proud of this piece of art. Think [35]Studio 54 1979. Being free.
   Living free. That cocaine audio. With the !llmind twist."

   Photos of Black Thought and Nickel Nine's perceivably explosion session
   as well as Four Three Two's album trailer can be found below.

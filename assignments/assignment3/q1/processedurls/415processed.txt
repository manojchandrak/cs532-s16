Message to Putin as U.S. ups NATO ante in Eastern Europe

U.S. adds a brigade worth of armour to Eastern Europe: 'Russians are going to
have a cow'

   U.S. President Barack Obama, who began pulling most U.S. troops out of
   Europe in 2012, is now shoving them back in, along with enough new
   battle tanks and artillery for another full infantry brigade to
   directly face Russia in Eastern Europe.

   This is serious business.

   The new move brings a fourfold increase in U.S. military spending in
   Europe — the largest increase since the Cold War ended — to backstop
   this highly mobile armoured force with its massive firepower.

   Consider that the roughly 5,000 new soldiers will lift U.S. strength in
   Europe up to 82,000 in three brigades, all concentrated on bolstering
   NATO's eastern defences bordering Russia.

   "This is a really big deal, and the Russians are going to have a cow,"
   predicted Evelyn Farkas, a former top Pentagon policy official.

   It's a pretty safe forecast.

   Russia quickly blasted Obama for escalating tensions "without any
   reason" and endangering stability in Europe, while hinting it would
   match any new buildup.

   "These steps by the U.S. and NATO are destabilizing and detrimental to
   the European security," the Russian Embassy in Washington charged.
   "There should be no doubt that Russia under any circumstances will be
   able to defend its citizens and national security interests."

'Persistent' presence

   The U.S. escalation, announced last week, is meant primarily to
   strengthen confidence on NATO's eastern flank, but the timing has
   surprised many observers.

   With Russia largely preoccupied with its military offensive in Syria,
   the confrontation over the Ukraine has seen "a sharp de-escalation of
   hostilities since August," according to the UN.

   Moscow also charges that this move puts the U.S. in breach of the 1997
   NATO-Russia agreement that pledges both sides to avoid placing large
   numbers of troops along borders facing each other — one of the pillars
   of post-Cold War confidence-building diplomacy.

   The NATO reply, which sounds rather like hair splitting, is that this
   new brigade will move around a lot and so will be a "persistent" but
   not a "permanent" presence on a border.

   Not surprisingly, Moscow's not buying that line.

   But Russia is in a weak position to protest against any U.S.
   destabilizing of European security given its own movement of armoured
   divisions westward, following the annexation of Crimea and the
   borderlands confrontation with Ukraine in recent years.

Several objectives

   In practical terms, Washington presents the new brigade as part of a
   continuing response to security fears that grew directly out of
   Vladimir Putin's bare-knuckle foreign and defence policies.

   But the escalation also has several objectives.

   First, it's meant to bolster the confidence of those Eastern European
   states that fear they might face Putin pressure tactics, or worse, in
   the future. These include NATO's eastern-most members, such as Hungary,
   Romania and Poland, and, most especially, the militarily weak Baltic
   states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.

   Many of these states have been critical of Obama for being naïve about
   Putin's expansionary intentions and not acting sooner to shore up NATO
   defences, something the president had hoped to leave to Western
   European governments.

   "They have finally realized that their previously weaker interest in
   this part of Europe hadn't done them any favours," Polish security
   expert Lukasz Kiser told the New York Times. "This decision will try to
   make up for that."

   There is also the strategic consideration that U.S. mobile brigades
   could quickly switch their focus to southern Europe if needed, should
   new crises flare up there in the wake of Middle East uncertainties.

   The Pentagon, for instance, is deeply concerned these days about the
   spreading anarchy in Libya, where ISIS is gathering new strength.

The 'realist' school

   As for the current buildup being directed eastward, this may be far
   less comforting to the "realist" school of Western diplomats who warned
   years ago that, apart from Poland, expanding NATO to the very borders
   of Russia would inevitably provoke unnecessary confrontations,

   But the U.S. buildup is clearly also meant to deliver a strong message
   throughout NATO, including one presumes to Canada, that Washington
   still regards Russia — not ISIS or China — as its most serious security
   threat.

   The move should also reinforce Washington's demands that the rest of
   NATO do much more to boost defence budgets and help strengthen the
   alliance's eastern front.

   Several NATO partners, including the U.K., France, Germany and Poland,
   are currently upping their own security efforts.

   And those cited as defence-spending laggards (and Canada is near the
   bottom rank) can expect more arm twisting.

   Canada, already struggling to expand its role in the Middle East, will
   surely be asked to show more effort on the ground in Europe as well.

Election year

   The previous Conservative government was working on plans to help staff
   a NATO headquarters in Poland and possibly add troops to a new NATO
   rapid reaction force in Eastern Europe.

   There's no clear indication yet of the Trudeau government's plans.

   Despite this new buildup, the situation is a far cry from the Cold War
   when millions of heavily armed NATO and Warsaw Pact troops (both backed
   by battlefield nukes) faced each other across a dangerous East-West
   chasm.

   bomb being released from Russian Su-24M jet fighter over Syria in
   October, an air campaign that NATO has strongly criticized. (Russian
   Defence Ministry Press Service/Associated Press)

   Still, crises erupt faster these days, and there's much worry that even
   a localized flare-up in Eastern Europe could escalate within hours into
   a much broader conflict.

   It is a common worry in foreign ministries now that the momentum of
   global upheaval has outstripped the capacities of diplomacy to react.

   There's clearly a profound need to avoid a new crisis in the region.
   And NATO and Moscow are supposed to reopen talks soon on how to reduce
   tensions in the months ahead.

   No one's very optimistic at this moment, however, given the uncertainty
   over Putin's intentions and the tumultuous politicking of a U.S.
   presidential election year.

   Still, we'd better hope sound statesmanship has at least some role to
   play before the escalation of forces takes on a momentum of its own.

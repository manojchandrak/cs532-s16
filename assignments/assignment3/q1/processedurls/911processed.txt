'OTWOL': Leah chooses career over Clark

   Vincent Garcia, ABS-CBN News
   Posted at 02/11/16 1:19 AM

   MANILA - The latest episode of "On the Wings of Love" had fans pleading
   to the series' writers, "quit playing games with our hearts, you're
   tearing us apart."

   If you're anything like the thousands of fans online, then you're
   probably reeling from the series' February 10 episode aptly hashtagged
   "#OTWOLTheBreakUp."

   It picked up where the last one left off, with Clark and Leah
   struggling to make their long-distance relationship work. An
   increasingly frustrated Clark battles for the scraps of attention he
   gets from Leah, whose focus remains her job.

   It wasn't all dark and gloomy, however, as the episode also sprinkled
   "kilig" moments via characters such as Tatang and Nanang, Tiffany and
   Tolayts, and Jigs and Angela.

   Fast forward to six months after and Leah found herself back in the
   Philippines to personally support her father's heart transplant. The
   surgery was a success, but being back home meant that she will have to
   face Clark, who --at this point-- was suffering from a bad case of
   inferiority complex.


   [71]A photo posted by @dreamscapeph on Feb 10, 2016 at 2:31am PST

   Clark confronted Leah, insisting that she gives up her work in Dubai
   and stay with him. He puts forth several arguments to make her do so
   such as her boss is in love with her and that she was turning into
   someone who would readily sacrifice family for her career.

   He conveniently dodged replies from Leah, who was trying to rescue
   their relationship by hammering down the point that she didn't care
   whether her boss was in love with her --the important things was that
   she was in love with him.

   Clark, unusually stubborn, ignored Leah's pleas and threw at her words
   such as "I don't know you anymore" and "You're only human, puwede ka
   madala ng tukso."

   Fuming, Leah slapped Clark. "Issue ito ng trust," she shouted at her
   husband. "Wala kang tiwala sa akin. ...Trabaho lang iyon. Walang ibig
   sabihin iyon. Ilang beses ko bang sasabihin sa iyo iyon?"

   Clark, seemingly adamant to break up with Leah, began forcing his wife
   to admit that she would rather work in Dubai than live with him.
   Apparently, that has always been his problem with Leah's decision all
   along.

   "Hindi na kita kilala! Look at yourself! Iba ka na! Iba magsalita, iba
   tumayo, at iba na rin ang priorities mo --hindi na ako!" Clark lectured
   Leah, before issuing an ultimatum. "If you go back to Dubai, tuluyan
   nang masisira ang relationship natin. So it's time for you to choose:
   it's me or your career."

   To which Leah, who did not want to reply at first, answered: "Trabaho
   ko."

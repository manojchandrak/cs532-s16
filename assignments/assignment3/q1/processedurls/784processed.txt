   Liddelow

   A HIGHLY venomous snake hasn’t deterred one large WA lizard from its
   lunch, with the southern heath monitor deciding a deadly tiger snake
   would make a good meal.

   Department of Parks and Wildlife officer Janine Liddelow photographed
   the reptile shortly after it had killed the venomous snake, near
   Walpole in the state’s south.

   Growing up to 1.5m, the southern heath monitor will eat small mammals,
   eggs and birds as well as other reptiles.

   Researchers have found a small piece of good news for people at high
   risk of some kinds of dementia: it might be possible to delay it or
   even prevent it.

   They found falling rates of vascular dementia in people who also
   happened to improve their heart health. The findings, published in the
   New England Journal of Medicine, support the idea that what's good for
   the heart is good for the head.

   "Our study offers cautious hope that some cases of dementia might be
   preventable or at least delayed," Claudia Satizabal of the Boston
   University Schools of Medicine and colleagues wrote in their report.

   They looked at more than 5,000 people who have been having their health
   tracked in minute detail as part of the Framingham Heart Study. The
   multi-generational study has been going on since 1948 and in 1971
   children of the original volunteers signed up. Their memory has been
   tested since 1975.

   "On average, since 1977, there has been a decline in the incidence of
   dementia of 20 percent per decade," the researchers wrote. The decrease
   in rates of vascular dementia has been 29 percent per decade.

   "The decline in the incidence of Alzheimer's disease was not
   significant, whereas the decline in the incidence of vascular dementia
   appeared to be more rapid than that of Alzheimer's disease," they
   added.
   ""Our study offers cautious hope that some cases of dementia might be
   preventable or at least delayed.""

   Keith Fargo, director of scientific programs for the Alzheimer's
   Association welcomed the findings.
   [100]advertisement

   "The incidence rates for dementia in the Framingham heart study appear
   to be decreasing over the past few decades and that's good news. It's
   probably not everything that needs to be done, but it's good news and
   it points us in a couple of directions about what we might be able to
   do to decrease the risk for dementia as people age," Fargo told NBC
   News.

   "We know that things like [101]increasing your physical activity,
   eating a [102]heart-healthy diet, making sure that you stay socially
   active, making sure that you stay cognitively engaged, if you smoke,
   stop smoking — all of these things are going to reduce your likelihood
   of cognitive decline as you age and may even delay or prevent
   dementia," Fargo said.

   But the news only applies to the mostly white people taking part in the
   study. A second study found dementia rates are highest in African
   Americans and lowest in Asian Americans.

   And the Boston team's findings only applied to people with a high
   school education or more. That supports other research that shows
   education can protect against dementia, probably by keeping the brain
   active and growing.

   Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia after
   Alzheimer's disease.

   One person who's doing her best to stave off dementia is Cynthia Huling
   Hummel, a retired pastor in Elmira, New York. She was diagnosed with
   mild cognitive impairment, which can progress to Alzheimer's, in 2011.

   Cynthia Huling Hummel, 61, is eating healthy, exercising, and keeping
   active in order to keep her condition from worsening — and her
   neurologist says it's working. courtesy of is Cynthia Huling Hummel

   "I was preparing for my doctorate, I was preparing to defend my
   dissertation and I couldn't remember any of the classes I had been
   taking," Hummel, who is 61, told NBC News.

   "I couldn't remember the material I had read. I couldn't remember the
   teachers or the students I had interfaced with so I knew there was a
   problem," she added.
   [106]advertisement

   "It's frustrating. It's embarrassing. By Wednesday I would forget what
   I had preached on Sunday," she said.

   Hummel retired, but she got busy trying to do what she could to prevent
   the dementia from worsening.

   "Getting more physically active, engaging myself more socially,
   challenging myself with more learning opportunities, being mindful of
   what I was eating, all those things," she said.

   "I take classes at Elmira College. I'm now taking my 28th class in
   almost 4 ½ years," Hummel added.

   "You want to pump that blood and stay physically active and again, what
   is good for the heart is good for the brain and so I swim three times a
   week at the Y."
   ""You want to pump that blood and stay physically active.""

   It appears to be working.

   "I went to see my neurologist last month and he said, 'Whatever you're
   doing continue to do it because it's working.' And so that is good
   news," she said.

   More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease. The Alzheimer's
   Association says more than 28 million baby boomers will develop the
   disease between now and 2050, and the cost of caring for them will
   consume nearly 25 percent of Medicare spending in 2040. It's[107] worse
   in women.

   A second study looked at just who gets dementia.

   Dementia rates in African Americans are 65 percent higher than among
   Asian Americans, the study found.

   "Our projections indicate that in every racial and ethnic group, over
   one in four people who survive to age 65 can expect to be diagnosed
   with dementia in their lifetime," said Rachel Whitmer, an
   epidemiologist at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, who led the
   study published in [108]an Alzheimer's Association journal.

   Her team's study of 274,000 members of Kaiser Permanente found dementia
   incidence over the 14-year study period ranged from an average annual
   rate of 26.6 cases of dementia per 1,000 people for African-Americans,
   to 15.2 cases per 1,000 people for Asian-Americans. In between were
   Latinos and Pacific Islanders with an average annual rate of 19.6 cases
   per 1,000 people, and whites with 19.3 per 1,000.

   Various studies have given people hints at what can [109]prevent
   Alzheimer's. [110]Regular exercise and eating plenty of fruits and
   vegetables helps.

   Others have shown that people who are[111] socially engaged are less
   likely to develop memory loss. Still others have shown that[112]
   keeping the brain active with puzzles or games can help, and a
   [113]whole industry has arisen out of that research.

Republicans Christie, Fiorina drop White House bids

   WASHINGTON | By [102]Ginger Gibson

   WASHINGTON New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former business
   executive Carly Fiorina ended their presidential campaigns on
   Wednesday, narrowing the field challenging front-runner Donald Trump in
   the race for the 2016 Republican nomination.

   Christie, 53, said in a Facebook post he was leaving the race "without
   an ounce of regret," a day after the combative Republican's sixth-place
   finish in the New Hampshire primary raised doubts about his viability
   as a candidate.

   Fiorina, 61, a former Hewlett-Packard chief executive, said in a
   Facebook post she would suspend her campaign. The only woman in the
   Republican field placed seventh in New Hampshire, one of a series of
   state-by-state nominating contests for the Nov. 8 election to succeed
   Democratic President Barack Obama.

   Trump's remaining opponents, most of them mainstream Republicans, will
   likely benefit from their departures, which leave seven Republicans
   from a field that once had 17 candidates.

   Trump won the New Hampshire Republican primary by almost 20 points. The
   fifth-place finish of U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who had
   hoped to emerge as Trump's main rival after a surprise third-place
   showing in Iowa last week, leaves Trump without a clear challenger
   among the so-called establishment candidates.

   On the Democratic side, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a
   democratic socialist, easily defeated former Secretary of State Hillary
   Clinton in the New Hampshire primary.

   The victories in both parties by candidates considered outsiders,
   testified to the sizable share of American voters upset over the slow
   economic recovery, immigration and America's place in the world and who
   are willing to shake up Washington.

   Trump, 69, a billionaire businessman, has a double-digit lead over
   conservative Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in opinion polls for the next
   Republican contest, the South Carolina primary on Feb. 20, according to
   a Real Clear Politics average of opinion polls.

   Christie poured much of his campaign's resources into New Hampshire and
   had considered a good showing there critical. He won only about 7
   percent of votes on Tuesday, despite a pugnacious performance at a
   Republican debate last weekend.

   "Christie needed to drop out. In short, he does not have the money or
   organization to be viable in South Carolina and beyond," said Monmouth
   University pollster Patrick Murray.

   "Christie was certainly hurt by Trump stealing his 'telling it like it
   is thunder,' but Christie was also out-organized in the ultimate retail
   politics state," Murray said.

   SANDERS COURTS AFRICAN-AMERICANS

   Trump's victory in New Hampshire showed pundits were wrong to think he
   would quickly self-destruct based on his penchant for insults and
   imprecise plans for the presidency. He had lost last week to Cruz in
   the first nominating contest, the Iowa caucuses.

   Ohio's Republican governor, John Kasich, finished second in New
   Hampshire, followed by Cruz, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and
   Rubio.

   The odds of Trump winning the White House, once seen as an extremely
   long shot, improved significantly after his victory in New Hampshire,
   online betting site Ladbrokes PLC said.

   Trump is now at 9/2, compared with 7/1 last week, meaning his chances
   of victory in November are now 18 percent. Clinton still had the best
   odds of becoming president at 50/50, Ladbrokes said.

   On the Democratic side, Sanders, 74, courted the African-American vote
   on Wednesday, having breakfast with civil rights leader the Rev. Al
   Sharpton at a restaurant in New York City's Harlem neighborhood.
   Clinton, 68, currently has strong support from black voters, who will
   be crucial in the Democratic primary in South Carolina on Feb. 27.

   Sharpton and Obama met at the same restaurant during Obama's successful
   2008 presidential campaign - a piece of symbolism for Sanders as he
   tries to expand his appeal beyond liberals in the U.S. Northeast.

   “My concern is that in January of next year for the first time in
   American history, a black family will be moving out of the White
   House," Sharpton, a Baptist minister and television talk-show host,
   told reporters afterward.

   "I do not want black concerns to be moved out with them. We must be
   front and center and not marginalized. And Senator Sanders coming here
   this morning further makes it clear that we will not be ignored," he
   said.

   Sharpton discussed a spate of police shootings of black males and other
   issues with the senator. Sharpton said he would not endorse a candidate
   until he met with Clinton.

   The Congressional Black Caucus will endorse Clinton on Thursday and its
   members will be active in supporting her campaign, the Washington Post
   reported, citing U.S. Democratic Representative Gregory Meeks of New
   York, chairman of CBC's political action committee.

   Clinton has a long history of support for civil rights. She also has
   benefited from husband Bill Clinton’s popularity in the black community
   during his presidency, although that became strained during her fierce
   2008 primary battle with Obama.

   Clinton's campaign, highlighting her popularity among black and Latino
   voters, said in a statement on Tuesday: "It will be very difficult, if
   not impossible, for a Democrat to win the nomination without strong
   levels of support among African-American and Hispanic voters."

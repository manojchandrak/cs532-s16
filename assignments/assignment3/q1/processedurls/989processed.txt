   KeyCorp is buying First Niagara Bank with 10 branches
   Buy Photo

   KeyCorp is buying First Niagara Bank with 10 branches possibly closing.
   Currently in the Culver Ridge Plaza in Irondequoit a KeyBank is four
   businesses down from a First Niagara Bank branch.

   ALBANY - Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday called on federal regulators to
   block KeyCorp's $4.1 billion deal to buy First Niagara, claiming the
   sale would have a "devastating impact" upstate.

   In a letter to high-ranking federal officials, Cuomo said the pending
   sale raises "serious anti-trust concerns" that would limit consumer
   access to an "unacceptably low level" in upstate New York.

   KeyCorp, the Ohio-based parent company of KeyBank, announced its
   intention to [59]buy First Niagara bank last October, with the sale
   awaiting approval by federal regulators and shareholders.

   "The consolidation is expected to result in thousands of lost jobs at
   the corporate and branch levels, with little hope these individuals
   will find alternative work in the retail banking field due to the
   oversaturated market conditions," Cuomo wrote. "In addition to the loss
   of jobs in local communities, consumers will face further limitations
   on branch access."

   Cuomo sent his letter to Scott Alvarez, general counsel of the Federal
   Reserve System's Board of Governors; Amy Friend, senior deputy
   comptroller and chief counsel for the Comptroller of the Currency; and
   Jeffrey Martino, chief of the antitrust division in the U.S. Department
   of Justice's New York office.

   First Niagara currently has 394 branches and 5,397 employees in New
   York, Pennsylvania and the New England region, according to the bank.

   That includes 51 branches and 2,260 employees in western New York, 65
   branches and 630 employees in the Southern Tier and central New York,
   and 34 branches and 266 employees in the tri-state area.

   There was no immediate comment from KeyCorp or First Niagara.

   Here's Cuomo's letter:

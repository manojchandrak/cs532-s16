       the food business and its key players.

   Actual quote from the website: "It's not that weird, we promise!"

   By Clint Rainey

   Bulletproof's fans exhausted from having to find, then melt their own
   yak butter for "upgraded" morning coffee are about to be in biohacked
   heaven: A rival called Grass Fed Coffee, the "world's first
   ready-to-drink butter coffee," has [84]just shattered its Kickstarter
   goal by raising $86,000 to bring to market a concoction that's part
   cold brew, part German butter, and all "mental clarity." The real
   novelty, though, is that these guys are canned -- just pop the top for
   eight immediate ounces of butter, a blend of Peruvian coffees/coffee
   extracts, MCT oil, and chicory. Grass Fed's creators [85]describe the
   product as "creamy" and "delicious," but they [86]caution restraint for
   first-timers: Start with half a can, since the effects ("mental
   clarity, focus, energy," and whatnot) can be "very strong at first for
   beginners."

   Bulletproof founder Dave Asprey, who's in the middle of transforming
   his e-commerce business into [88]a retail chain with spinoffs like
   [89]Fat Water, a product understandably described as having an
   "appetite-suppression effect," apparently hadn't thought up the idea of
   bottling his oily coffee yet. Despite having practically the same
   ingredients and claiming to offer the same purported health benefits,
   Grass Fed has no relation to Bulletproof, which means this new start-up
   can probably expect a hail of scoffs from [90]Gwyneth Paltrow's doctor,
   [91]Third Eye Blind, and the rest of Dave Asprey's followers.

Indian leopard injures six in Bangalore school

     * 8 February 2016
     * From the section [62]India

   Media captionLeopard wreaks havoc in school in India

   A male leopard which entered a school in the Indian city of Bangalore
   injured six people trying to capture it.

   A scientist and a forestry employee were among those mauled during the
   near 10-hour long effort to corner the dangerous animal on Sunday.

   The leopard, which strolled into the Vibgyor International school, was
   eventually tranquillised and released.

   A recent wildlife census estimated that India has a leopard population
   of between 12,000 and 14,000.

   The eight-year-old male was spotted strolling inside the school
   premises in the Kundalahalli area.

   Footage on the school's security cameras showed it attacking a man near
   a swimming pool.

   police launched an operation to capture the animal

   Conservation scientist Sanjay Gubbi and forest department employee
   Benny Maurius were injured when they tried to corner the animal and
   tranquillise him, reports say.

   "It was a long struggle to capture the leopard. Although it was
   injected with tranquillisers it could be captured only around 20.15
   local time when the medication took full effect," senior police
   official S Boralingaiah told reporters.

   Wildlife official Ravi Ralph told the BBC Hindi's Imran Qureshi that
   the leopard possibly strayed into the school from a patch of forest not
   far from the school.

   The captured animal has been moved to a national park and the six
   injured people, including a cameraperson of a TV channel, have been
   treated for minor injuries.

   Leopards and other big cats have been known to stray into populated
   areas, and conservationists have warned that such confrontations may
   increase as humans encroach on animal habitats.

   Last year a male leopard spent five hours with its [63]head stuck in a
   metal pot in a village in the northern state of Rajasthan.

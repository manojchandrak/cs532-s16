Lana Del Rey’s Druggy ‘Freak’ Video Is The Beach Party Of Your Dreams

   The third video from Honeymoon is here.
   by [59]Sasha Geffen 2/10/2016

   [60]Lana Del Rey has revealed her new video for the third single from
   Honeymoon, “Freak.”

   The 11-minute clip premiered Tuesday night at a screening in Los
   Angeles. It’s now online and it features all the druggy California
   partying you could possibly want in a Lana vid.

   Meet The ‘Freak’ Behind Lana Del Rey’s New Video

   In the video, Lana sips cherry-colored liquid from a plastic cup and
   feeds a tab of (presumably) acid to her co-star, [61]Father John Misty.
   The girls from the “Music to Watch Boys to” video also make a return
   appearance, lounging on the beach with LDR and FJM and floating
   underwater during an extended piano-scored outro.

   “Freak” continues the sexy, violent, and intoxicated mood of the
   Honeymoon videos we’ve seen so far. Watch it below.

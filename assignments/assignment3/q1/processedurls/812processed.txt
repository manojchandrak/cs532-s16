   [38](EnviroNews World News) — Advocacy group [39]Environment America
   has “crunched the numbers” in an effort to reveal who the largest
   polluters of American waterways are. The culprits that crack the top-15
   list may very well surprise you.

   If you ask people on the street who America’s biggest water polluter
   is, for many, oil Goliaths like Exxon or Chevron might be first to come
   to mind — but not by a long shot would either of those be the correct
   answer.

   AK Steel Holding Corp took the slimy grimy first-place prize, with
   transnational mega meat marketer Tyson Foods coming in a very close
   second. Two oil companies, Phillips 66 and ExxonMobil, did make the
   top-15 — but only in 13th and 15th places respectively.

   Interestingly, nearly half the entities on the list were food and meat
   producers, but it’s the third-place finisher that’s been raising some
   eyebrows as well.

   According to the analysis, the U.S. government, and specifically the
   Department of Defense (DOD), is the third largest water polluter in
   America, having dumped some 63,335,653 pounds of poison into waterways
   from 2010-2014.

   The data was compiled using numbers from the Environmental Protection
   Agency’s (EPA) [40]Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) program. According to
   [41]EPA’s website, “TRI tracks the management of certain toxic
   chemicals that may pose a threat to human health and the environment.
   U.S. facilities in different industry sectors must report annually how
   much of each chemical is released to the environment.”

   Amongst the many potentially deadly substances released by DOD are
   chemicals, rocket fuel and toxic sewage — but it’s the carcinogenic and
   mutagenic radioactive isotopes let loose by its nuclear munition plants
   that make DOD’s emissions exceptionally dangerous. The Department’s
   myriad facilities, dedicated steadfastly to perpetuating ongoing
   participation in the nuclear bomb game, have been leaking and leeching
   lethal radiation from the dawn of the nuclear age, to the present day.

   In other words, the very Defense Department that is supposed to be
   protecting American citizens from mortal threats, is, in and of itself,
   one of the deadliest threats Americans face — not from bombs or guns,
   but from millions of pounds of pollution, perpetrated on the country’s
   unsuspecting population every year, by way of the Pentagon itself.

   A perfect example can be drawn by examining Hanford, the infamous
   Manhattan-era nuclear bomb manufacturing plant and waste dump, in
   Washington State. A classic investigative long-read in Rolling Stone
   Magazine, from all the way back in 1990, titled, “America’s Worst
   Polluter,” sounded the alarm over DOD/DOE’s exorbitant toxic emissions,
   and wrote of Hanford:

     By far the most dangerous form of pollution caused by government
     mismanagement comes out of the Department of Energy’s
     nuclear-weapons facilities… After four decades of research and
     manufacturing, the DOE is stuck with billions of gallons of
     radioactive and chemical byproducts, principally at four
     locations:.. …at Hanford alone, the wastes would cover an area the
     size of Manhattan with a lake forty feet deep.

   Another interesting point that must be drawn from Environment America’s
   summation is that although the Department of Energy (DOE) didn’t crack
   the top-15 list, it is nonetheless a huge polluter as well.
   Additionally, NASA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the
   Department of the Interior (DOI), the Federal Aviation Administration
   (FAA), the Department of Justice (DOJ) and multiple other agencies are
   also offenders, leaving the befuddling question: Is the U.S. government
   the biggest polluter of all?

   It is important to note that Environment America’s recent analysis
   specifically addresses releases into waterways, and excludes air
   pollution and landfill sources — also part of TRI reporting.
   Nevertheless, the sheer scope of the government’s polluting activities
   needs further examination across the board.

   Stay tuned to EnviroNews, as we intend to explore this question more
   thoroughly in future investigative reports, but let’s just say for now
   that the stats aren’t looking good for the U.S. government — and those
   numbers look even worse if you live in any of the many communities
   poisoned by the ongoing and nebulously toxic deeds of the U.S.
   government.

[44]Tyson Foods Accused of Dumping More Poison to Waterways Than Exxon, Dow,

     (EnviroNews World News) – The environmental advocacy group
     Environment America has released an analysis that concludes meat
     manufacturer Tyson Foods is a bigger polluter of American waterways
     than Exxon, Dow, Koch and pretty much anyone else – with the sole
     exception of AK Steel Holding Corp…

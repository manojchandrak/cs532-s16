   [24]SZA, [25]Dej Loaf and [26]Tinashe are getting their Fugees on.

   T: The New York Times Style Magazine brought in some of top female
   talent in hip-hop and R&B to participate in a shoot for its Spring
   Women’s Fashion issue. The magazine brought in some of today’s rising
   stars including Dej, the TDE leading lady, Tinashe, Awful Records
   members Lord Narf and ABRA, Empress Of and Jean Deaux.

   With the Spring Women’s Fashion issue scheduled to be released on
   Sunday (Feb. 14), the New York Times unveiled a video highlighting all
   the women involved in this particular shoot. In a video dubbed “On Set:
   Hip-Hop and R&B’s Freshest Female Voices,” the singers and rappers
   offer up their own rendition of Roberta Flack and The Fugees’ “Killing
   Me Softly With His Song.”

   Dej Loaf and Lord Narf are the only ones who don’t cover “Killing Me
   Softly” as the two rappers deliver original verses in the video. Narf
   kicks off the video with some rhymes while Dej Loaf caps it off with a
   few of her own. The rest of the women do their finest job with the
   vocals as they try to live up to the great work of Roberta Flack and
   Lauryn Hill’s iconic renditions of the song.

   Speaking of Dej Loaf, the 2015 XXL Freshman was recently
   [27]highlighted as one of hip-hop’s top young moneymakers in a video by
   Forbes. The Hip-Hop Cash Kings list was compiled by Compiled by
   Hit-Boy, Charlamagne Tha God, Atlantic Records Craig Kallman
   Lovebug Starski and three Forbes staffers.

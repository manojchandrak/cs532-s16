   Jack and Rose's Titanic love is stronger than ever.

   [32]Kate Winslet is more than hopeful that [33]Leonardo DiCaprio will
   finally win an Oscar for his work in The Revenant.

   "It does really feel as though it's Leo's year and I'm just super
   excited for him," Winslet told E! News earlier today while promoting
   her new flick Triple 9. "And [there's] the sense of good will behind
   him, and that everyone wants it for him. You know, people in the
   streets. It's really really wonderful. I think it's real testament to
   that fact that he's such a lovely person and that people really not
   only admire him but also really like him and respect him .

   "I feel quite proud of that, it's lovely," she said, holding back
   tears. "I keep getting emotional when I talk about Leo."

   Too sweet.

   Meanwhile, Winslet revealed who she'll be wearing to the Oscars, where
   she's up for actress in a supporting role for her work in Steve Jobs.

   "I'm working with Ralph Lauren and they're making something for me and
   it's lovely," she said. "It's been a really fun process actually and
   them including me quite a lot and my ideas, their ideas, and what works
   and what doesn't. It should be fun. I just want to be comfortable. I
   just don't want to have any zips that break. That's my whole thing,
   zips. I have zip fear."

   But she refuses to let the fashion critics get the best of her. "You
   get on the carpet and all bets are off," Winslet said. "You just smile
   and wave, just get through it and then don't read any press. That's my
   trick--I don't look at any of it. I just get through it, have a glass
   of champagne and go home."

   Triple 9 is in theaters on Feb. 26.

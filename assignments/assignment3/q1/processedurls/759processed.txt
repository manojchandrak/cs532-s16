Helen Mirren, Ed Norton, Michael Pena and Naomie Harris also feature.

   Kate Winslet is in negotiations to join the all-star cast of Collateral
   Beauty, New Line’s unconventional drama being directed by David
   Frankel.

   Will Smith leads a cast that already includes Helen Mirren, Ed Norton,
   Michael Pena and Naomie Harris. Keira Knightley[39] is also in
   negotiations to join the cast.

   The Allan Loeb-written script centers on a New York advertising exec
   (Smith) who experiences a deep personal tragedy. His colleagues devise
   a unique plan to break him out of his depression — which works, but not
   in a way that anyone imagined.

   Earlier reports that Rachel McAdams was in negotiations proved to be
   premature.

   Village Roadshow Pictures is co-producing/co-financing the project,
   which is targeting a mid-February start in New York. Collateral
   Beauty has just been [40]slated for release on Dec. 16.

   Winslet is making the awards circuit rounds currently due to her best
   supporting actress nomination for her work in Steve Jobs. She next
   appears in the crime thriller Triple 9, which opens Feb. 26.

Officer confronts robbery suspects as they exit gas station in Vaughan

   York Regional Police cruiser file photo

   Chris Herhalt, CP24.com
   Published Wednesday, February 10, 2016 1:21PM EST

   York Regional Police say one of their officers just happened to be
   outside a Vaughan gas station when three men accused of robbing it
   stepped outside to make their escape.

   Just before midnight on Tuesday, the officer was patrolling in the area
   of Steeles and Kipling avenues because of several recent hold-ups in
   the area.

   A few minutes later, police said three men entered a gas station near
   the intersection, allegedly demanding cash and cigarettes from a gas
   station employee. One of the men allegedly drew a handgun.

   Police say the gas station employee suffered minor injuries.

   As the three suspects exited the gas station, the patrolling officer
   challenged them and was able to stop two of them, placing them under
   arrest. The third suspect fled on foot.

   A loaded revolver, cash and cigarettes were recovered.

   An investigation linked the two suspects in custody to another robbery
   at the same gas station that occurred on Jan. 8, as well as a grocery
   store robbery on Hullmar Drive in Toronto that occurred on Jan. 21.

   Felipe Udofe, 21, of no fixed address, has been charged with three
   counts of robbery with a firearm and three counts of wearing a disguise
   with intent.

   Anthony Debattista, 18, of Toronto, faces the same six charges.

   The outstanding suspect is described as a black male, standing
   five-feet-ten inches to six feet tall. He is approximately 20 to 25
   years old. He was last seen wearing all black clothing.

   Anyone with information is asked to contact police at 1-866-876-5423,
   ext. 6631, or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477 (TIPS).

   Marc Shmuger Takes Over EuropaCorp From

   UPDATED: Former Universal Pictures Chairman [48]Marc Shmuger is
   replacing [49]Christophe Lambert as chief executive of  [50]EuropaCorp,
   the international production and distribution company behind
   the “Taken” and “Transporter” franchises, according to multiple
   sources.

   The reason behind Lambert’s sudden ouster was not clear, though one
   individual familiar with the situation speculated that it may have been
   tied to Lambert’s reported difficulties working with filmmakers. They
   were said to find him arrogant and irrational, “leading with his ego,”
   according to one source, who had first-hand knowledge of Lambert’s
   relationships with directors and [51]producers.

   Lambert’s ouster came after an emergency meeting of the EuropaCorp
   board Wednesday, with the embattled CEO reportedly recalled from
   California to Paris and fired, said two sources. EuropaCorp’s
   spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment. Lambert also
   could not be reached.

   Despite his ouster, others who worked with Lambert say he is a smart,
   capable executive who played a key role in both the creative and
   financial decisions at EuropaCorp. Well schooled in office politics he
   was seen as a savvy operator who was believed to be EuropaCorp
   founder  [52]Luc Besson’s right hand.

   Shmuger intially takes the helm of EuropaCorp on an interim basis,
   according to two sources. It is a company with big ambitions for
   expanding its film production and distribution operations. It faces one
   challenge in that its principal U.S. partner, Relativity Studios, has
   been struggling to get back on its feet after six months in Chapter 11
   bankruptcy.

   Besson, one of France’s most financially successful filmmakers, is a
   long-time friend of Shmuger’s. Their relationship dates back to the
   days when the American was a junior marketing executive at Sony,
   promoting Besson films, including the critically-acclaimed “Fifth
   Element” and “The Professional.” Shmuger later served as an executive
   producer on Besson’s 2014 science fiction hit, “Lucy,” which starred
   Scarlett Johansson.

   Besson had tried to lure Shmuger to the Beverly Hills-based EuropaCorp
   as far back as the latter’s days as head of [53]Universal Pictures,
   according to one source. But Shmuger was not ready to make the leap
   until now, after nearly seven years running his own [54]production
   company, Global Produce.

   Shmuger was said to be in Paris, taking the reins from Lambert and the
   rest of the EuropaCorp board Wednesday, before flying home to
   California, where he planned to meet with the company’s staff,
   according to an individual familiar with the company.

   “I am thrilled to be working again with Luc, who has long been and
   remains one of the most unique and accomplished filmmakers in the
   world,” Shmuger said in a statement. “It’s a happy reunion to be
   working so closely alongside him and his incredible EuropaCorp team, in
   both Europe and the United States.”

   Shmuger took the job as interim CEO, but with the possibility of
   staying on, according to the source. He will continue to operate Global
   Produce, which soon will  open the Alex Gibney documentary, “Zero
   Days,” at the Berlin Film Festival. The doc about Iran’s nuclear
   facilities comes two years after the Gibney-directed, Shmuger-produced
   “We Steal Secrets,” about Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden, two
   hackers who helped push the government’s Internet secrets into the
   public square.

   Shmuger also produced “The Spectacular Now,” featuring a trio of young
   stars — Miles Teller, Shailene Woodley and Brie Larson and has been
   working with Universal on a reboot of the drug lord epic “Scarface.”

   EuropaCorp’s upcoming features include the science fiction picture
   “Valerian,” “The Circle,” an adaptation of a David Eggers’ novel with
   Emma Watson and Tom Hanks, and “Miss Sloane,” a gun control thriller
   with Jessica Chastain.

       If Lambert was fired because he was “arrogant and irrational” and
       “lead with his ego” then they just traded the student for the
       master. Those traits are Shmuger’s calling cards. Lets see how long
       that boob lasts there.

       Not “Miss Julie” with Jessica Chastain, you mean “Miss Sloane”!!
       “Miss Julie” was made and out already. Wow, lots of errors on this
       original post.

       Yeah, so that’s the wrong Christophe Lambert you have pictured
       there. Hilarious.

            Because the actor CL had a moderately successful prod co with
            his wife at the time Diane lane, when I first went to meet
            with Christophe lambert at Europa Corp I was tingling to sit
            down with the actor turned exec… He said I was not the first
            or the last, that this happens to him all the time. He’s a
            very capable COO and a good guy – but the highlander he is not
            :)

                 The initial posting of the article had a big photo of
                 actor Christopher Lambert as the cover pic. They have
                 since revised it.

Feds sue Ferguson to force police reform

   The U.S. Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against the city of
   Ferguson, Missouri after their city council rejected a consent decree
   seeking to reform their police and municipal court system. USA TODAY

   WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department is suing the city of Ferguson in
   an attempt to forcibly overhaul the city’s troubled police and court
   operations, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Wednesday.

   The decision comes hours after city leaders sought to revise a long-
   negotiated settlement, citing prohibitive costs of executing such a
   deal.

   “There is no cost for constitutional policing,'' Lynch said late
   Wednesday.

   "Painstaking negotiations lasted more than 26 weeks as we sought to
   remedy literally years of systematic deficiencies,'' she said of the
   government's action, which followed a public announcement last month of
   a tentative agreement that the attorney general described as "both fair
   and cost-effective . . . Last night, the City Council rejected the
   consent decree approved by their own negotiators; their decision leaves
   us no further choice.''

   Lynch said the residents of Ferguson have been waiting "decades for
   justice,'' having endured civil rights breaches that established a
   pattern and practice of racially biased policing .

   "I think the city of Ferguson had a real opportunity to step forward
   here,'' a visibly disappointed attorney general said. "Instead, they
   have chosen to step in the past.''

   Earlier Wednesday,  Ferguson Mayor James Knowles signaled that the city
   was ready to take on the Justice Department in federal court. He
   defended Ferguson's unanimous decision to revise the agreement by
   removing language from the agreement, which local leaders asserted,
   mandated big raises for police officers.

   Local leaders also sought to free the city from its obligations under
   the agreement should Ferguson seek to shutter the police department
   altogether and enlist another agency to provide public safety services.

   "The ball is in their court," Knowles said at a hastily called news
   conference in Ferguson. "We're sitting and waiting to talk. If they
   want to threaten legal action, then that's what they're threatening."

   The threat became reality within hours of the mayor's appearance when
   the Justice lawsuit was filed in a Missouri federal court, alleging
   local law enforcement conduct routinely violated the Constitution.

   "The residents of Ferguson have waited nearly a year for their city to
   adopt an agreement that would protect their rights and keep them
   safe,'' Lynch said. "They have waited nearly a year for their police
   department to accept rules that would ensure their constitutional
   rights and that thousands of other police departments follow every
   day.''

   Justice Department threatens legal action against Ferguson

   When Ferguson and Justice reached a tentative agreement last month,
   Knowles said the city did not then have a clear understanding of the
   cost of implementing it.

   "I don't know if I'd characterize it as an absolute agreement in
   principle," Knowles said. "Also an agreement in principle doesn't allow
   you to assign a numerical value of every piece of the agreement."

   The push to amend the deal comes after Knowles and council members
   raised concerns it could cost nearly $10 million over the next three
   years to implement.

   The city of 21,000 has a budget of about $14 million and is facing
   about $2.8 million in debt after the August 2014 police shooting death
   of an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, sparked weeks of sustained
   and often violent protests. Much of the debt accrued from
   police overtime during the unrest following Brown's death and lost tax
   revenue from businesses destroyed or badly damaged in rioting.

   A St. Louis County grand jury declined to indict Darren Wilson, the
   officer involved in the incident, and the Justice Department said it
   would not pursue federal civil rights charges against him. But the
   incident and subsequent protests led Justice to launch a wide-ranging
   investigation, concluding nearly a year ago that the city's police and
   municipal court unfairly targeted African-American residents, who make
   up about 70% of the population.

   Ferguson's troubles and similar problems in cities across the country
   prompted a national discussion on police tactics and the appointment of
   a special White House panel, which in part urged the adoption of new
   strategies to rebuild a broken trust between law enforcement and the
   communities they serve.

   In Ferguson, city leaders hosted a series of emotionally-charged
   hearings this month on whether it should ratify the tentative
   Justice settlement. Some residents urged the City Council to reject the
   deal and take their chances in court. Others favored the agreement as a
   way for the city to regain the trust of a wary African-American
   community.

   Wesley Bell, a Ferguson council member, said members of the council
   felt it was important present their concerns about the costs of
   implementing the deal. He said the amendments to the agreement were not
   meant to be a "take it or leave it" offer.

   "We hope the Justice Department is willing to sit down and talk to us
   and continue negotiations," Bell said. "If this case goes to court, it
   will not be because of the city of Ferguson."

   Proponents of Justice agreement noted that fighting a legal battle
   would be costly and could prove more expensive in the long-term than
   settling now. Knowles disputed that notion Wednesday, saying the city's
   analysis shows "the agreement, as it currently stands, will cost more
   to implement than it would be to fight a lawsuit."

   "Substantially more," Knowles added.

Twitter is betting on these 5 things in 2016 (TWTR)

   Twitter is betting on these 5 things in 2016 (TWTR)
   REUTERS/Lucas JacksonTwitter just released its fourth quarter earnings
   and it's not looking good.Its shares were downas much as13% after
   reporting no user growth, despite an earnings beat. It now rebounded
   and is down about 2% in after hours.But Twitter has a plan to improve
   its service, and it shared some of it ina letter to shareholders posted
   on its website.In it, the company laid out the following 5 priorities
   it will focus on this year to drive further growth:Refinement of core
   service: Fix some of hte broken parts, like the fact that you have to
   type a period before somebody's user handle if you want anybody else on
   Twitter to see it, and improve the timeline to show the most relevant
   tweets to its users. It also wants to make it easier for new users
   too.Live streaming video: Invest heavily in expanding its live video
   streaming capabilities, leveraging some of its existing products like
   Periscope.Creators and influencers: Focus on itsmost creative and
   influential users, like musicians and journalists, and help them expand
   their reach through things like Vine and Moments.Safety: Work on safety
   measures to encourage freedom of expression and prevent online
   harassment, and implement technology to detect the use of abusive
   language.Developers: Continue to invest in developers to make Twitter
   easier and faster to use.Here's the full text from the shareholder
   letter:OUR SERVICEWe have five priorities in 2016 to serve this focus:
   refinement of our core service; live streaming video; our creators and
   influencers; safety; and developers. Each is critical to us
   strengthening our platform and audience around live.First, Twitter is
   an iconic service and a globally recognized brand. We are going to fix
   the broken windows and confusing parts, like the .@name syntax and
   @reply rules, that we know inhibit usage and drive people away. We're
   going to improve the timeline to make sure you see the best Tweets,
   while preserving the timeliness we are known for. The timeline
   improvement we announced just this morning has grown usage across the
   board (including Tweeting and Retweeting). We're going to improve
   onboarding flows to make sure you easily find both your contacts and
   your interests. We're going to make Tweeting faster while making Tweets
   more expressive with both text and visual media. We're going to help
   people come together around a particular topic, such as our @NBA
   timelines experiences. Relentlessly refining Twitter will enable more
   people to get more out of Twitter faster.Second, we have amazing
   technology for live streaming video. Periscope lets anyone on the
   planet broadcast and watch video live with others. We recently added
   the ability to broadcast from a GoPro camera, and to watch any
   broadcast live from a Tweet. Pairing Periscope with Twitter gives
   broadcasters greater distribution (anywhere a Tweet can be displayed, a
   Periscope can too) and the ability to hook into our revenue products.
   We believe live streaming video is a strong complement to the live
   nature of Twitter, and it helps instantly explain the value of our
   service. We're going to invest heavily in these first-screen, connected
   audience experiences. Being able to instantly broadcast and watch a
   live stream with others is extremely powerful and entertaining.Third,
   Twitter is by far the fastest way to talk with the world. And because
   of that, we have the most creative and influential people and
   organizations in the world actively Tweeting. Whether its musicians
   releasing albums or polling people to help name their albums,
   journalists Tweeting their stories and getting feedback, artists,
   activists, athletes, and politicians, established or emerging these are
   the people who shape and influence culture, and they bring the audience
   that follows through Twitter. And we love them! Vine and Niche have
   proven their ability to create new talent and match them with marketers
   to make a living from their passion. We will focus on helping these
   creators build and connect 4 with their fans and audience through
   Twitter by giving them better tools. And we're going to enable more
   people and media partners to create and share Moments, which is proving
   to be a great medium for storytelling through Tweets.Fourth, we will
   continue to invest more resources in making our platform safer. We
   stand for freedom of expression, and people must feel safe in order to
   speak freely. Online harassment and abuse is a difficult challenge.
   This year we will implement technology to help us detect the use of
   repeat abusive accounts, make it much simpler to report multiple
   abusive Tweets or accounts, and give people simpler tools to curate and
   control their experience on Twitter. But its not just about creating
   better tools and technology; we will also be smart and adaptive about
   our policies in this area and invest in faster response times. Finally,
   were going to emphasize educating people about our safety tools and
   features as we roll them out.Fifth, we're going to continue to invest
   in developers. We want developers to be able to build their businesses
   with Twitter. We are investing in mobile with Fabric, our platform that
   helps developers build, grow, and make money with their apps. Fabric
   has grown from 0 to 1.6 billion active mobile devices in just 18
   months. We believe there's huge strategic value in building a platform
   for developers that helps us grow our reach. We are investing in making
   it easy for developers to discover, curate, and seamlessly publish
   great, live stories with Twitter content using TweetDeck, Curator, and
   embedded Tweets. More than one billion visitors to our developers sites
   and apps already see these embedded Tweets every month. We believe that
   these sites and apps are incredibly important amplifiers that show the
   huge reach and importance of Tweets. Finally, we will continue to
   invest in helping developers make their businesses more productive by
   understanding their customers and markets with Twitter data.After
   months of consideration, we've made significant changes to our
   organization to ensure more disciplined execution. We moved all of
   Engineering, Design, and Consumer Product under our CTO Adam Messinger.
   This is a new structure for our company, and we will take an
   engineering and design led approach to making Twitter faster and more
   intuitive. We moved Revenue product, our Media team, and Human
   Resources to our COO Adam Bain. We promoted Kayvon Beykpour, the lead
   for Periscope, to our executive team. Kayvon brings a very strong
   product sense to the table to make everything we do at Twitter better.
   And we added Leslie Berland to our executive team as CMO to help us
   better show the power of Twitter. Our top priority is to recruit
   phenomenal leadership who bring a fresh and creative perspective and
   help us recruit more great talent.Our focus on live is a unique reason
   to use Twitter to quickly see what's happening in the world and talk
   about it. That creates a connected audience unlike any other, which
   continues to grow our business in a complementary way.NOW WATCH: An

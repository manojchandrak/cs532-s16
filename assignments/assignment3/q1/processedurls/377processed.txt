Nigerian refugee camp hit by twin suicide bombings

More than 70 killed in attacks at a camp in Borno state for people displaced
by Boko Haram-related violence.

   11 Feb 2016 05:03 GMT | [122]Boko Haram, [123]Nigeria, [124]War &
   Conflict, [125]Africa

   More than 70 people have been killed in a double suicide attack at a
   camp for internally displaced people in northeast Nigeria, local
   officials told Al Jazeera.

   The twin suicide bombings in Borno state on Tuesday morning -
   reportedly committed by women - also left 78 people injured, officials
   added.

   Information about the attacks was first reported by officials on
   Wednesday night.
   The bombings occurred at a camp in the town of Dikwa, some 80km
   northeast of Maiduguri, the birthplace of Boko Haram.

   Ahmed Satomi, of the State Management Agency, told Al Jazeera officials
   had arrested one woman who had refused to detonate a bomb after
   travelling to the camp from a nearby town with two other bombers.

   "The one they arrested alive, she confessed. She feel that her parents
   would come and that's why she refused to detonate her own bomb," Satomi
   said.

   Al Jazeera's Ahmed Idris, reporting from Katsina in northern Nigeria,
   said attacks on civilian targets by suspected Boko Haram fighters have
   been on the increase recently in Nigeria.

   "Officials are telling us that the injured have been evacuated for
   medical attention. The army, which is fighting Boko Haram, has yet to
   comment on this recent attack. But the finger of blame is already
   pointing at Boko Haram," Idris said.

   The camp is home to 50,000 people driven from their homes by the armed
   group, whose six-year-old rebellion has killed 20,000 people and made
   2.5 million homeless.

   IDP camp attacks

   Boko Haram, which has increasingly used suicide and bomb attacks as
   Nigeria's military pushes them out of territories they once controlled,
   has hit camps for internally displaced people before.

   On September 11 last year, seven people were killed when an improvised
   explosive device went off at the Malkohi camp, near Yola, in
   neighbouring Adamawa state.

   The camp has been used to house kidnapped women and children rescued by
   the military.

   On January 31, [126]at least 86 people were killed in Dalori, some
   12km from Maiduguri, when Boko Haram fighters attacked and burned down
   surrounding villages.

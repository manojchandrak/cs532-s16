   What might the [209]Manchester United team look like on the opening day
   of the 2016/17 season?

   Ed Woodward resisted the temptation to splash out in the January
   transfer window but United are expected to spend again when the summer
   transfer window opens.

   Our writers have had a look at the current squad and identified the
   areas they think United should strengthen. And they've taken it upon
   themselves to sign the players they think should fill the gaps and
   picked their team for the opening day of next season.

   Have a look at the XIs below and have a go yourself by using the
   selector at the bottom.

Stuart Mathieson

   Despite a traumatic season for United there are still some success
   stories who deserve to stay put following any rebuild and a few who've
   had iffy and inconsistent debut campaigns for the Reds who deserve the
   bedding in time before kicking on hopefully next season.

   In the latter category are Matteo Darmian and Morgan Schneiderlin. In
   particular the Frenchman has the credentials to be United's anchor man.
   A freshen up in front of him is needed in midfield and young England
   players Ross Barkley at Everton and Tottenham's Dele Alli are a perfect
   vibrant fit.

   Dele Alli has had a fine season.

   Defensively David De Gea and Chris Smalling have been on top of their
   game and hopefully Luke Shaw will return to peak form. The addition of
   Everton's impressive John Stones would make up a solid back four.

   Anthony Martial stays, of course, but a new look hitman is needed an
   Borussia Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang would be a dangerous
   addition.

   To top it off Gareth Bale from Real Madrid would add the Galactico
   touch United seem to demand these days.

   New signings: John Stones, Ross Barkley, Dele Alli, Gareth Bale,
   Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.

   Stuart's 2016/17 XI: De Gea, Darmian, Smalling, Stones, Shaw,
   Schneiderlin, Barkley, Alli, Bale, Aubameyang, Martial.

Rob Dawson

   It's been a difficult season for United that might still end in
   disaster if they don't qualify for the Champions League.

   But they aren't that far away from having a competitive team. The squad
   will need some surgery in the summer - whoever the manager is - but
   perhaps not as much as some think.

   Aymeric Laporte in action for Athletic Bilbao against Barcelona.

   David De Gea, Chris Smalling, Luke Shaw and Anthony Martial would have
   a chance to getting into most sides. Then there are players like Matteo
   Darmian, Morgan Schneiderlin and Juan Mata who are among the best in
   the world in their positions.

   There are, though, gaps to fill. United need a centre-back to partner
   Smalling and Aymeric Laporte - young, left-footed and comfortable on
   the ball - seems to be a perfect fit.

   There's room for an energetic midfielder like Ilkay Gundogan to compete
   with Ander Herrera to play next to Schneiderin.

   Marco Reus would provide the pace out wide that United have missed
   while a top-class striker like Robert Lewandowski or Karim Benzema is a
   must if they want to challenge for the title.

   New signings: Aymeric Laporte, Ilkay Gundogan, Marco Reus, Robert
   Lewandowski.

   Rob's 2016/17 XI XI: De Gea, Darmian, Shaw, Smalling, Laporte,
   Schneiderlin, Gundogan, Mata, Reus, Martial, Lewandowski.

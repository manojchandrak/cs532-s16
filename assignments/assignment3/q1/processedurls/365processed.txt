Study Links Concussion to Higher Risk of Later Suicide

   MONDAY, Feb. 8, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Average people who suffer a
   concussion may be three times more likely to commit suicide years after
   their brain injury, a new Canadian study suggests.

   Further, the long-term risk of suicide appears to increase even more if
   the head injury occurs during a weekend, researchers found.

   Based on these results, loved ones and physicians should keep a close
   eye on anyone who's had a concussion, even if the head injury happened
   years ago, said senior author Dr. Donald Redelmeier, senior core
   scientist at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences and a
   physician at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center in Toronto.

   "Nobody commits suicide in the immediate weeks or the immediate months
   after the concussion," Redelmeier said, noting that suicide tended to
   occur on average nearly six years following the head injury.

   It's important to note, however, that this study only showed an
   association between concussion and suicide; it did not prove a
   cause-and-effect link.

   Most research on long-term effects of concussion has involved military
   veterans and professional athletes, Redelmeier said. But he and his
   colleagues wanted to investigate whether garden-variety concussions
   cause any lasting problems for the general population.

   They combed medical records to find every adult diagnosed with a
   concussion anywhere in Ontario during a two-decade period. The
   researchers looked for people who had concussions, but didn't need
   surgery and didn't need to be hospitalized, Redelmeier said. They came
   up with more than 235,000 people who'd had a concussion. From this
   group, 677 committed suicide.

   Concussion patients wound up committing suicide at a rate of 31 per
   100,000 people annually, researchers found. That's more than triple the
   average Canadian suicide rate of nine per 100,000 people each year,
   Redelmeier said

   Findings from the study were published Feb. 8 in the CMAJ.

   People who got a concussion on the weekends fared even worse, with four
   times the average suicide rate, the researchers said.

   The increased risk remained even after researchers accounted for people
   with a prior history of psychiatric problems.

   "That's an important finding in and of itself," said Dr. Robert
   Glatter, an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City
   and former sideline physician for the New York Jets football team.
   "Just having concussion increases suicide risk in patients without a
   psychiatric history. All primary care physicians and pediatricians need
   to be aware of this study."

   Weekend concussions probably have longer-lasting effects because they
   receive less medical attention, the experts suggested.

   Concussions during weekdays typically occur on the job, where "we often
   have a more regimented type of follow-up," Glatter said.

   "People are referred to the emergency department after such injuries
   because they are job-related and they will be compensated for follow-up
   care," he said.

   On the other hand, weekend concussions often are related to recreation
   or sports activities, Glatter and Redelmeier said. People are more
   inclined to shake off those head injuries and not get proper care.

   "If you want to get back up and back in the game, no one will stop you,
   and some of your teammates or your coaches might even encourage that,"
   Redelmeier said.

   There are several theories why concussions might be related to
   increased suicide risk, the experts said.

   Repeated concussions are thought to cause lasting injuries to the brain
   that affect brain chemistry, increasing the risk of mood disorders that
   can lead to suicide, Glatter said.

   These findings show that concussions may have an impact on long-term
   brain health, Redelmeier added.

   "A concussion doesn't do anybody any good," Redelmeier said. "It can
   injure hundreds and hundreds of neurons inside the skull, every one of
   which might be important for something."

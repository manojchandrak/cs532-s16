   Zika research to be published rapidly, and free: statement AFP
   Wednesday, February 10, 2016
   Mariette Le Roux
   Paris (AFP) - Top research institutions, funders and publishers said
   Wednesday they would make all scientific findings on the Zika virus
   assailing Latin America available speedily, and free.
   A statement signed by the journals Nature, Science and The Lancet, the
   Chinese Academy of Sciences, France's Institut Pasteur, the Bill and
   Melinda Gates Foundation and the Japan Agency for Medical Research and
   Development said data was a crucial tool in fighting the public health
   emergency.
   "Journal signatories will make all content concerning the Zika virus
   free to access," the document said.
   For their part, research funders will require scientists to share
   interim as well as final data as rapidly and widely as possible.
   The route to publication can be a long, slow one, and research findings
   are usually not shared until after they have been published in a
   peer-reviewed journal.
   "The arguments for sharing data, and the consequences of not doing so,
   have been thrown into stark relief by the Ebola and Zika outbreaks,"
   the document stated.
   "In the context of a public health emergency of international concern,
   there is an imperative on all parties to make any information available
   that might have value in combatting the crisis."
   The statement urged other organisations to follow suit.
   Other signatories included Doctors Without Borders (MSF in its French
   acronym), The New England Journal of Medicine, PLOS Science Journals,
   the South African Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust.
   The move was welcomed by experts as a sea change in public health
   research.
   - Life-saving -
   Trudie Lang, director of the Global Health Network, said the response
   to Zika -- even more so than in the case of Ebola -- was being
   hamstrung by the many unknowns.
   "We are still to prove that Zika causes microcephaly, and we need to
   know at what point damage happens in pregnancy, should this be the
   case," she said in comments issued by the Science Media Centre in
   London.
   "In addition we need to develop better diagnostic tools and agree how
   to interpret anomaly scans to assess how these affected babies are
   developing."
   Data needs to be shared as quickly as possible, she said, "to address
   all these questions concurrently."
   Lang also stressed the need to ensure the data is reliable and
   accurate.
   This "requires research sites to be well trained and have the resources
   they need to collect and manage data in ways that avoid error," she
   said.
   Infectious diseases professor Mark Woolhouse from the University of
   Edinburgh described the commitment as one of the most welcome
   developments in decades.
   "If acted upon, this declaration will save lives," he said.
   An outbreak of the usually benign Zika virus in Latin America and the
   Caribbean has coincided with a surge in babies with microcephaly, a
   condition that causes them to have unusually small heads and brains,
   leading to death or disability.
   No scientific proof has been found that Zika causes microcephaly,
   though the UN's World Health Organization (WHO) has said a link is
   "strongly suspected" and has declared Zika a "public health emergency
   of international concern."
   There is no cure or vaccine for the virus which, in most people, causes
   mild symptoms.

SAG-AFTRA Joins Call for More Diversity: "This Moment Isn't Only About Race"

The union says the ultimate goal is "more and better jobs for all of our
members."

   SAG-AFTRA is adding its voice to the call for greater diversity in the
   entertainment industry. The guild’s President’s Task Force on
   Education, Outreach and Engagement and SAG-AFTRA Diversity Advisory
   Committee approved a statement in a joint meeting on Feb. 3 that was
   issued on Wednesday.

   The statement sets forth a number of principals: it says the current
   focus on diversity isn’t just about race but also disability, age,
   gender, gender identify and sexual orientation; it commits the guild to
   focusing on inequities “in terms of opportunity, treatment and
   compensation”; it says statistics are a helpful tool in measuring
   progress, but the ultimate goal is “more and better jobs for our
   members”; and it calls for greater inclusion throughout the industry.

   “A lack of diversity permeates our industry, and SAG-AFTRA as an
   organization is committed to affecting change,” said SAG-AFTRA
   president Ken Howard. “Our Equal Employment Opportunity & Diversity
   Department is solely dedicated to making change on the front line, but
   inclusivity is something we care deeply about throughout all facets of
   our union.”

   “There does seem to be momentum now towards inclusiveness,” added
   SAG-AFTRA executive vp Gabrielle Carteris. “But we won’t really see
   change happen until those in authority take responsibility and choose
   to make decisions based on authenticity. These decisions directly
   impact which stories and people are present and, more importantly,
   which are missing.”

   Jason George, chair of the SAG-AFTRA diversity advisory committee,
   commented: “The most creative workplaces and most dynamic environments
   are flush with diversity. The faces we see on screen and voices we hear
   on the radio deeply matter to an audience hungry for authenticity."

   The complete SAG-AFTRA statement follows:

   It is a founding principle and included in our union’s mission
   statement that: “It is a core value of SAG-AFTRA that our strength is
   in our diversity. We are committed to the broadest employment and
   involvement of our members, regardless of race, national origin,
   ancestry, color, creed, religion, sex, marital status, sexual
   orientation, political affiliation, veteran status, gender identity or
   expression, age or disability. SAG-AFTRA strives to educate and engage
   members so that they may be full participants in the workings of their
   union. We are proud to be a model of inclusion, democratic organization
   and governance.”

   We proudly wish to publicly speak to our partners throughout the
   entertainment and news media with an invitation to continue the
   dialogue and, perhaps most importantly, suggest solutions to the
   situation in which we still find ourselves in 2016:

   This moment isn’t only about race. This isn’t only about the lack of
   faces and voices of color. This is about disability. This is about age.
   This is about gender and gender identity. This is about sexual
   orientation. This is about the diversity of our stories, of our
   experiences, of our perspectives. So many of these are, right now,
   missing from our screens.

   SAG-AFTRA members work in the most visible workplace on the planet and
   we will continue to use this visibility to shine a light on the
   inequity that still exists throughout all levels of the entertainment
   and news media — in terms of opportunity, treatment and compensation.

   Statistical representation is a helpful tool to measure progress but
   isn’t the ultimate goal. It’s about more and better jobs for all of our
   members; in particular those who have been historically and
   categorically denied opportunities to compete for these jobs.

   Greater inclusion is needed throughout every level: from executive
   suites, to writers’ rooms; from agencies to the cast and crew members
   on-set. All the greenlighters and gatekeepers need to understand that
   this is a business imperative and not a politically correct luxury —
   audiences are choosing authenticity over platitudes and will continue
   to make those choices with their time and their money.

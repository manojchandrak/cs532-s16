   Another day, another look at A24’s upcoming release of The Witch… on
   tap today [36]Crypt TV joins us to present a new featurette that tells
   us how the film represents a 17th century nightmare. Let’s hope it’s
   one we can wake up from!

   In this exquisitely made and terrifying new horror film, which debuts
   on February 19th, the age-old concepts of witchcraft, black magic, and
   possession are innovatively brought together to tell the intimate and
   riveting story of one family’s frightful unraveling.

   Directed and written by Robert Eggers, [37]The Witch (review) stars
   Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Ineson, Kate Dickie, Harvey Scrimshaw, Ellie
   Grainger, and Lucas Dawson.

   Synopsis:
   Set in New England circa 1630, The Witch follows a farmer who get cast
   out of his Colonial plantation and is forced to move his family to a
   remote plot of land on the edge of an ominous forest rumored to be
   controlled by witches. Almost immediately, strange and unsettling
   things begin to happen–the animals turn violent, the crops fail, and
   one of the children disappears, only to return seemingly possessed by
   an evil spirit.  As suspicion and paranoia mount, everyone begins to
   point the finger at teenage daughter Thomasin. They accuse her of
   witchcraft, which she adamantly denies… but as circumstances become
   more and more treacherous, each family member’s faith, loyalty, and
   love will be tested in shocking and unforgettable ways.

   Writer/director Robert Eggers’ debut feature, which premiered to great
   acclaim at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival (and won the Best Director
   Prize in the U.S. Narrative Competition), painstakingly recreates a
   God-fearing New England decades before the 1692 Salem witch trials, in
   which religious convictions and pagan folklore famously clashed. Told
   through the eyes of the adolescent Thomasin — in a star-making turn by
   newcomer Anya Taylor-Joy — and supported by mesmerizing camera work and
   a powerful musical score, The Witch is a chilling and groundbreaking
   new take on the genre.

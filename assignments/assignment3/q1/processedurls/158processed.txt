U.S. Justice Dept. files civil rights lawsuit against Ferguson, Mo.

'We intend to aggressively prosecute this case,' says Attorney General

       recommendations

       guidelines

   The U.S. Justice Department filed a civil rights lawsuit against
   Ferguson, Mo., on Wednesday to enforce a police and court reform plan
   after the city said it wanted to amend some aspects of a consent decree
   it had reached with the federal agency.

   The Justice Department initiated a civil rights investigation into
   Ferguson's policing after an unarmed black teenager was killed by a
   white police officer in 2014. It resulted in a report that was
   extremely critical of Ferguson's police and court systems.

   "The residents of Ferguson have waited nearly a year for their city to
   adopt an agreement that would protect their rights and keep them safe,"
   Attorney General Loretta Lynch said at a news conference. She said the
   agreement that was decided upon had been painstakingly negotiated and
   Ferguson officials knew that rejecting it would invite litigation.

   A statement from Lynch outlined the negotiations between the Justice
   Department and city representatives, saying talks "lasted more than 26
   weeks as we sought to remedy literally years of systematic
   deficiencies."

   "We intend to aggressively prosecute this case and I have no doubt that
   we will prevail," the statement said.

   Earlier on Wednesday, Ferguson officials said they wanted to negotiate
   further with the Justice Department over police reforms, after voting
   on Tuesday to amend the agreement.

City council sought conditions

   Mayor James Knowles told a news conference that reforms had to be
   affordable and attainable. "It serves no one's purpose for us to fail,"
   he said.

   Ferguson's city council voted on Tuesday to accept the reform
   agreement, called a consent decree, subject to conditions, including
   that it not be required to increase police officers' pay and police
   staffing levels. It also said it wanted more time to comply with the
   other terms.

   The city became a symbol of problems with policing and race in the
   United States after 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed by Ferguson
   Police Officer Darren Wilson in August 2014. It was one of several
   killings of black men, mostly by white officers, that started a
   nationwide debate about the use of excessive force by police,
   especially against minorities.

   Knowles said that only in the last two weeks had the city been able to
   analyze the costs of implementing the decree. He and city council
   members said Ferguson had already made some reforms, including
   community policing and a civilian review board to oversee police.

   Civil rights advocates warned that litigation with the Justice
   Department could cost more than implementing the agreement.

   "This decision only creates the potential for the type of litigation
   that creates more financial challenges that will be a burden on poor
   people," said Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change, a
   national civil rights organization.

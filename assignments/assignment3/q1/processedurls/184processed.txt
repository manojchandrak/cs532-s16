   BSA - Generalist

   [SnVsaWEuR3Jhc3NvLjc5MTMyLjI3MjNAaGFydmV5bmFzaHVzYS5hcGxpdHJhay5jb20.gi
   f]

   Position: BSA - Generalist
   Contract: 6+ months
   About the role:
     * This is a generalist BSA/Program manager. They are working on the
       INTERNAL SYSTEM product, and all of the products this platform
       supports

   Internal System
     * The agent portal experience
     * This portal currently enables liberty mutual agents to sell
       services, manage services (add drivers to an auto policy, change
       billing methods, etc), and they need to make it possible for both
       internal agents and outside 3^rd party agents
     * They are building this portal for outside agents to deliver all of
       their experiences
          + Currently over 100 individual projects and they need to tie
            together and be integrated
          + There are about 12 major products, currently all with
            individual UIs.
     * With INTERNAL SYSTEM, this will be the framework through which all
       individual UIs are delivered. It will facilitate integration of one
       UI to another. Basically make the UI consistent regardless of which
       part of the portal you're under (billing info, customer info,
       policy info, etc)

   Responsibilities/ideal experience:
     * Project Management, traditional BSA work
     * User Acceptance testing
     * Identify non-functional requirements
     * Content management/publishing
     * Loose QA experience

   Soft Skills:
     * Someone who can identify areas of need, work with ambiguity, and
       remove it!
     * Not shy or bashful - working with stake holders and different teams
       depending on the day
     * Customer service oriented - a lot of this is dealing with agent
       questions and on the new portal and all the products the role
       supports. Think like a user and make it more user friendly - be
       proactive about what would make sense for the framework.

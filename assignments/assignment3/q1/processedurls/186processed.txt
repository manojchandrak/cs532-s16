   'Arrow': Who's In the Flash-Forward Grave? Seven Likely Suspects The
   Hollywood Reporter Wednesday, February 10, 2016
   Sydney Bucksbaum
   For [2]Arrow fans, "Who's in the grave" has become the new "What's in
   the box?"
   Back in the fall, [3]the final moments of Arrow's season four premiere
   revealed that someone would not make it to the end of the season alive.
   A flash-forward scene set six months in the future showed Oliver
   (Stephen Amell) kneeling next to a freshly dug grave in a cemetery,
   holding back tears. The Flash's Barry (Grant Gustin) arrived after the
   funeral ended (he was too busy battling Zoom to make it on time) to
   give Oliver his condolences, showing that whoever died was important to
   both men.
   After that shocking scene aired, fan speculation ran rampant on social
   media, leading many to wonder if fan-favorite character Felicity (Emily
   Bett Rickards) was fated to die this season. Since she's the love of
   Oliver's life and one of Barry's closest friends, it would make sense
   that her death would affect them both in major ways. But [4]the
   midseason premiere revealed the only person who is definitely not in
   the grave is Felicity, since another flash-forward scene showed the
   newly-paralyzed former IT girl waiting for Oliver in the limo at the
   cemetery. Notably, she was furious at Oliver in the second
   flash-forward and her engagement ring was nowhere to be seen.
   So if it isn't Felicity in the grave, who is it? Here are the most
   likely candidates for who is fated to die this season on Arrow:

   7. Laurel (Katie Cassidy)
   Would the show really kill off another Canary? After Laurel's sister
   Sara (Caity Lotz) was shot and killed last season, Laurel brought her
   back to life via the Lazarus Pit. Now the White Canary is off saving
   the world and traveling through time on Legends of Tomorrow while
   Laurel has taken over saving Star City as the Canary. While Laurel's
   death would be quite the blow for Team Arrow, it's doubtful that her
   death would make Felicity so angry at Oliver.
   6. Thea (Willa Holland)
   Oliver's sister has been suffering from the side of effects of the
   Lazarus Pit all season long, but after refusing to give in to her
   bloodlust, she's now in a coma in the hospital. Her prospects certainly
   don't look good, but her father Malcolm Merlyn (John Barrowman), aka
   the new Ra's al Ghul, probably won't let his daughter die without a
   fight. If he has to physically put a sword in her hand and stab some
   random person to save her life, he definitely will. Total father of the
   year material.
   5. Diggle (David Ramsey)
   Diggle is both Oliver and Felicity's best friend and the glue that
   holds Team Arrow together, so it's more likely that his death would
   cause so much grief for everyone, including Barry. And
   since Diggle doesn't have a fate laid out by DC Comics, while his death
   would certainly have emotional ramifications for everyone (he is a new
   father, after all), it wouldn't rock the boat story-wise for the
   future.
   4. Oliver's son William (Jack Moore)
   Since the Arrow showrunners didn't name Oliver's newfound son Connor,
   it's safe to say that William doesn't have much of an impact on
   Oliver's future as a superhero â€”  at least not according to DC Comics
   lore. As of right now, only Oliver and Barry know about William's
   existence in Central City, and so it would make sense that his death
   would be so infuriating and hard for Felicity to cope with (since
   Oliver still hasn't confessed to her that he has a son). And there's
   nothing like having to bury your child to completely wreck someone to
   the point of vowing to kill the person responsible, even though Oliver
   has given up killing his opponents in an attempt to be the hero Star
   City deserves.

   3. Lyla (Audrey Marie Anderson)
   While Diggle's wife isn't officially a part of Team Arrow, she still
   helps out the team from time to time, and she's certainly considered
   family to everyone, making her death a huge loss for the team. Since
   she's already in H.I.V.E.'s and Shadowspire's crosshairs, it's not that
   big of a stretch to consider her a potential victim. Plus, the fact
   that she's a new mother would hit Oliver especially hard, pushing him
   to seek out revenge no matter how dark it would be.
   2. Quentin Lance (Paul Blackthorne)
   Laurel's father has spent all season working as a double agent for Team
   Arrow, spying on Damien Dahrk (Neil McDonough) and H.I.V.E. and
   reporting back to Oliver. If/when Dahrk discovers Lance has been
   double-crossing him, his response will be severe. Plus, now that Team
   Arrow knows Lance is dating Felicity's mom, his death would have even
   more of an impact on the team. Felicity doesn't agree with putting
   Lance in such a dangerous role, and so his death as a result of
   Oliver's idea wouldn't make her all that happy.
   1. Donna Smoak (Charlotte Ross)
   Oliver's future mother-in-law and Felicity's mother is the most likely
   candidate for who is in the grave. Her death would cause so much grief
   and anger between the two of them as well as inspire Barry to run all
   the way from Central City for his best friend's mother's funeral.
   Additionally, it would also affect Team Arrow the most. Their actions
   would presumably cause Dahrk (or whoever the mysterious "he" is who
   killed the person in the grave) to kill someone close to the team. If
   Dahrk discovers Lance's betrayal, who better to kill than the woman he
   loves? Since Laurel can defend herself against an attack, Donna is just
   a civilian and an easier target. Her death would be a debilitating hit
   for everyone on Team Arrow.

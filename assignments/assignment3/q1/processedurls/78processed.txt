Prison sentences: Plans 'to encourage' early guilty pleas

     * 11 February 2016
     * From the section [66]UK

   New sentencing guidelines intended to encourage earlier guilty pleas
   are to be consulted on in England and Wales.

   The Sentencing Council says a sentence reduction of a third must only
   be given to those who plead guilty the first time they enter a plea.
   Currently, defendants must plead at first "reasonable opportunity".

   It said the proposals would spare more victims the trauma of a trial.

   The Ministry of Justice said no decisions had been made.

   Currently defendants can have their sentence reduced by up to a third
   if they plead guilty at the "first reasonable opportunity", which has
   been open to interpretation by different judges.

   Under the new proposals, they will have to plead guilty the first time
   they are asked for their plea in court to receive this reduction.

   The maximum reduction for those who admit guilt after this would also
   be reduced from 25% to 20%.

   Under the new draft guidelines, the sliding scale for sentencing
   reductions would be:
     * One-third - for an offender who offers a guilty plea the first time
       he or she is asked in a court
     * One-fifth - the maximum available to someone who pleads guilty at a
       later opportunity but before the first day of the trial - the
       current maximum reduction in those circumstances is one-quarter
     * One-tenth - the maximum for anyone who changes to a guilty plea on
       day one of their trial
     * Zero - for any offender who waits until part-way through a trial to
       plead guilty

   No reduction in sentence would be offered to someone pleading guilty to
   murder where the judge determines they should receive a whole life jail
   term.

'Incentive not reward'

   The requirement that courts should take into account a guilty plea in
   deciding what sentence an offender should get is a long-standing
   principle set out in law by Parliament.

     Guidelines must not become straitjackets that prevent judges from
     making the right decision in individual casesMark Fenhalls QC,
     Criminal Bar Association

   The council said the new guidelines provided "a much tighter framework"
   and "much less scope for offenders to 'play the system' and still
   receive the maximum discount".

   "There is an understandable reluctance to provide those who are guilty
   with a 'reward' for pleading guilty, especially when they have little
   or no prospect of being acquitted," it said.

   "However, it is important to recognise that the guilty plea reduction
   is in place to provide an incentive and not a reward.

   "For it to work effectively, it is important that it is a clear and
   unqualified incentive to the defendant."

Analysis

   BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman

   Not everyone agrees that reducing sentences for those who plead guilty
   is a good thing, but the law builds this discount of sentences into the
   criminal justice system.

   The reasons are straightforward.

   Guilty pleas spare victims and witnesses the stress of a trial, and
   free up police, prosecutors and courts for other cases. They also save
   public money.

   The significant change in today's proposal is the creation of a greater
   incentive for defendants to plead guilty at the first court hearing.

   The current maximum one third reduction in sentence stays for those who
   plead at that point.

   But the reduction in sentence is lowered if someone pleads guilty later
   on in the process.

   For those who plead after that first stage the maximum reduction will
   be 20%, down from the current 25%.

   Reductions continue to drop the closer to the trial date the plea is
   entered.

   The great prize is efficiency and certainty.

   Removing cases at an early stage means they don't gum up the system and
   affect timetabling.

   This gives victims and witnesses in contested cases clarity and a far
   higher degree of certainty as to when their case will be heard.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chairman Lord Justice Treacy said: "We want those who have committed
   crimes to admit their guilt as early as possible.

   "When they do, it means victims and witnesses can be reassured that the
   offender has accepted responsibility for what they have done and that
   they are spared having to appear at court to testify.

   "It also means that the police and Crown Prosecution Service can use
   their resources more efficiently to investigate and prosecute other
   cases."

'Vulnerable' defendants

   The council stressed that nothing in the new guidelines "should be
   taken to suggest that an accused person who is not guilty of an offence
   should be pressured to plead guilty".

     Following the spending review, there is no financial need to cut
     prison numbers over the next five years. Protecting the public will
     always be our top prioritySpokesman , Ministry of Justice

   Mark Fenhalls QC, chairman of the Criminal Bar Association, said
   "clarity and consistency" in sentencing was welcome, but flexibility
   was also vital.

   "There has to be a proper balance between the interests of the public,
   victims and the rights of defendants to fair process, without undue
   pressure being placed on defendants who are often vulnerable.

   "Defendants who plead guilty early must always receive more credit than
   those who game the system. But guidelines must not become straitjackets
   that prevent judges from making the right decision in individual
   cases."

   A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: "The changes in the consultation
   would lead to stricter sentences as those pleading guilty later in the
   process will get a smaller reduction.

   "There would be no change to the reduction for those pleading guilty at
   the earliest point in the process.

   "Following the spending review, there is no financial need to cut
   prison numbers over the next five years. Protecting the public will
   always be our top priority."

   The Sentencing Council was set up by Parliament to promote consistency
   in sentencing while maintaining the independence of the judiciary.

   It recommends sentences according to the relative seriousness of
   different offences, and the seriousness of the offender's behaviour
   relative to that of others convicted of the same crime.

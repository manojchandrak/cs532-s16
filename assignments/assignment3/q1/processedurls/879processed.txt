Greg Bird: James Roberts "doesn't think when he speaks"1:24

   NRL: Greg Bird has seen the lighter side of negative comments former
   teammate James Roberts made to Titans coach Neil Henry.

   [player]

   OFF-contract Storm star Cooper Cronk has hired player agent George
   Mimis to help him decide his NRL future.

   Cronk has managed his own affairs throughout his illustrious career,
   but he has opted to link with Mimis and his SFX Sports Group company in
   a bid to sort through a number of options for 2017 and beyond.

   The Storm, Maroons and Kangaroos halfback has attracted interest from
   Sydney clubs St George Illawarra and South Sydney, who are both keen to
   secure the Melbourne playmaker’s signature.

   As [238]revealed by The Sunday Telegraph last month, Cronk is seriously
   weighing up moving to Sydney to be with his partner — Fox Sports
   presenter Tara Rushton.

   It’s understood the Dragons have already tabled Cronk a significant
   offer, despite the Queensland and Australian No. 7 turning 33 in
   December, while the Rabbitohs are also in the mix for his services.

   Despite the interest, Melbourne remains hopeful of retaining Cronk —
   who has played 275 games for the Storm since making his debut in 2004.

   On top of enlisting Mimis for contractual guidance, Cronk is also keen
   to use his extensive experience to capitalise on his brand and
   business.

   Mimis also manages Storm star Billy Slater — who has become one of the
   NRL’s most marketable players under his guidance.

   The notoriously private Cronk believes self-promotion of his brand is
   an area he can develop and improve upon and it’s why he wanted to hire
   a manager to build a business plan.

   Cronk is expected to make a decision on his playing future beyond this
   season in the coming weeks.

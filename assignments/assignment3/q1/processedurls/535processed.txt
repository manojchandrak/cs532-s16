   Reno Mayor Hillary Schieve declared it Guy Clifton Day to honor
   the Nevada journalist who wrote for the Reno Gazette-Journal for 22
   years.

   Clifton's family, friends and former co-workers crowded the council
   chambers Wednesday to recognize his work telling the stories of the
   state's characters, special events and places Nevadans hold dear.

   Clifton's position was eliminated last month as part of a reduction in
   force at RGJ Media.

   Schieve's proclamation, read by her sister Amanda Schieve
   Crawford, honored Clifton as a "a renown and respected journalist who
   has dedicated his entire career to covering Nevada and Nevada history."

   Clifton, a native Nevadan born in Gabbs, graduated from the University
   of Nevada, Reno with a journalism degree and worked for the
   Gardnerville Record-Courier, Tahoe Bonanza and Tahoe World
   before landing at the Reno Gazette-Journal. He became a nationally
   recognized Reno Rodeo reporter and covered other special events such as
   Hot August Nights for the RGJ.

   Councilman David Bobzien remarked that Clifton's work pushed him to be
   a better elected official.

   "Most importantly, the value of his journalism in informing me about
   the stories, the conditions, the issues that individuals face, those
   are our constituents," Bobzien said. "I feel like my public service is
   better because of that."

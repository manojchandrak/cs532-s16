   GLASGOW, Scotland -- This giant rabbit is in search of his Hoppy Ever
   After.

   The Scottish SPCA is looking for someone to adopt its continental giant
   rabbit named Atlas.

   Staff at the center in Cardonald, Glasgow, took in the 7-month-old
   continental giant rabbit when his owner could no longer look after him,
   the Scottish SPCA [34]said in a press release.

   "Atlas is already about the size of a westie and is still young with
   some growing to do," said center manager Anna O'Donnell. "He is a very
   friendly rabbit who loves attention and getting cuddles."

   [35]On Facebook, the SPCA called Atlas a, "larger than life rabbit."

     Our centre in Glasgow is seeking a new home for a larger than life
     rabbit.The 7 month old continental giant rabbit...
     Posted by [36]Scottish SPCA on [37]Monday, February 8, 2016

   But not just anyone can care for this big bunny.

   O'Donnell said a standard rabbit hutch won't do for Atlas. The new
   owner will need plenty of space for this growing rabbit.

   They also said they are ideally looking for someone who has kept a
   continental giant before.

   "We are looking for a specific home for Atlas due to his breed and
   size," O'Donnell said.

[16]Jordan Wines 2016 harvest tasting with a view!

   Thursday 11th February 2016 - Posted by Chris von Ulmenstein

   [18]image Yesterday a number of writers celebrated the current harvest
   with hosts Gary and Kathy Jordan of Jordan Wines, an event which
   highlighted how climate change is affecting grape harvesting too.

   The venue for the 2016 harvest tasting was at the highest point of the
   Jordan property, with a magnificent view over the Stellenbosch Kloof
   valley on a perfect (if hot) summer day. Singita Sommelier
   François Rautenbach and I were the last to arrive, and were driven to
   this spectacular tasting setting by Eben, who greeted me with
   exceptional friendliness, having been a past colleague of my son at
   Delaire Graff.  Benches had been set up at the viewpoint, and Gary and
   Kathy took turns in talking about the current harvest.

   Gary had prepared a schedule showing how locally and [19]image
   internationally the average grape growing season temperature has
   increased, not only locally, but internationally too, including at
   Geisenheim in Germany, and at Beaune in France. Jordan Wines is
   compensating for the temperature increase by planting grapes in higher
   cooler sites, and by planting new cultivars.  One of these is the [20]
   image Greek-style Assyrtiko, a white wine grape from Santorini and
   Paros, which is often used for blending. Jordan will experiment with
   the cultivar under the guidance of South Africa’s foremost
   viticulturist Rosa Kruger. They will be spreading the cultivar across
   different sites, including the Swartland, Gary said.

   Kathy told us that the 2016 vintage is the earliest ever, by one day
   relative to last year.  This year the harvest is slow and controlled,
   [21]image Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc ripening at the same time.
   Kathy also said that they have a lower juice recovery this year, with
   tight bunches. They will harvest whites first, and then reds, which is
   what the cellar was designed for. It was sad to hear that they have
   seen no chameleons on the farm since the start of the summer , but they
   may have gone under to hide from the heat.

   Some guests walked back and others were driven back to Jordan Bakery,
   [22]image where we had lunch on the deck. Gary told me that Chef George
   Jardine is opening on Andringa Street in Stellenbosch next week, a
   fine-dining restaurant which will help keep his staff busy in winter,
   when things slow down. We started off with a generous bread plate of
   olive bread, brioche, seed loaf, with butter, pesto, and tapenade.
   [23]image The starter was a chilled tomato and cucumber gazpacho,
   perfect for the heat of the day.

   We had placed our main course order before we left for the wine
   tasting. Very generous options available were butter-roasted
   yellowtail, served with a tomato and fennel velouté, homemade potato
   gnocchi, and [24]image wilted spinach; Brioche Bunny, a brioche bun
   filled with aromatic curried Karoo lamb, raita, and coriander,
   pronounced to be excellent by Drinks Feed’s Anel Grobler; rare roasted
   Chalmar beef sirloin, slow roasted tomatoes, caramelised onions, olive
   tapenade, and rocket; and rocket and Cremona Gorgonzola salad, rosa
   tomatoes, Granny Smith Apple, with crushed walnuts.

   Jordan Bakery Manager [25]image Louise Starey took our coffee orders,
   and brought platters of Bakery sweet treats of chocolate brownies,
   meringues, chocolate tarts, and mini cheesecakes, for us to share.

   We enjoyed a relaxed yet informative time at Jordan Winery, in the
   friendly company of Gary and Kathy, and their staff.

   Disclosure: We received a bottle of Jordan Cabernet Sauvignon 2013 on
   our departure.

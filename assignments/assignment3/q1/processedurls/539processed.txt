   Puff Daddy To Host Gala Fundraiser At Playboy Mansion
   [31]11

   Puff Daddy is to host a gala fundraiser at Playboy Mansion,
   [32]Billboard reports. The event will benefit CITY, short for
   Community's Inspiring Today's Youth, a non-profit based in Los Angeles
   that seeks to provide mentorship for young entrepreneurs. The gala is
   scheduled to be after the Grammys Monday (February 15).

   Virgin Group founder Sir Richie Branson is to be the keynote speaker at
   the CITY gala fundraiser hosted by [33]Puff Daddy. On the bill to
   perform are Kool of Kool & the Gang, Chanel West Coast and DJ Paul
   Oakenfold.

   Other events scheduled to be a part of the gala include a celebrity
   poker tournament and a fashion show from Hemp Blue.

   "We are honored to have such an incredible roster of distinguished
   guests joining us to raise visibility for these important charitable
   causes," executive producer Ryan Long says in a statement.

   Astronaut Buzz Aldrin and businessman and philanthropist John Paul
   DeJoria are to receive the Lifetime Achievement Award and Legacy of
   Inspiration Award, respectively.

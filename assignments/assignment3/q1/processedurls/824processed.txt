Delays, costs mount for Canadians renouncing U.S. citizenship [38]Add to ...

   A crush of Canadians seeking to give up their U.S. citizenship is
   causing long delays and mounting frustration.

   A record number of Americans willingly renounced their U.S. citizenship
   in 2015 as the burden of a sweeping U.S. tax crackdown spreads. U.S.
   Treasury Department figures released this week show that 4,279
   individuals renounced last year, up from 2,999 in 2014 – a 43-per-cent
   jump.
   How to renounce your Canadian citizenship (it's surprisingly simple)
   (The Globe and Mail)

   Becoming un-American has become a protracted and costly journey,
   particularly in Canada, where it can take up to a year or more due to
   significant backlogs at the U.S. embassy and consulates.

   “It’s very clear that there is no particular attempt to make it easier
   to get out – to provide more resources or expedite the process,”
   complained John Richardson, a Toronto citizenship lawyer, who has
   guided numerous Canadians through the complex process.

   The U.S. publishes the names of people who renounce every quarter, but
   it does not disclose their citizenship or where they apply. Experts
   believe a significant chunk, if not the majority, are from Canada, home
   to hundreds of thousands of Americans.

   From start to finish, renunciation can take a year or more, depending
   on where in Canada the application is made. Wait times at the U.S.
   consulate in Toronto are particularly long, according to lawyers and
   tax experts.

   “Toronto may be the renunciation capital of the world,” Mr. Richardson
   said.

   The United States has twice increased the processing fee – to $2,350
   (U.S.) from $450 in 2014. Before 2010, it was free. The fee hike hasn’t
   stemmed the flow, which nonetheless remains small relative to the
   seven-million-plus Americans living in other countries and the larger
   number of people who become U.S. citizens.

   Some Canadians are travelling to other cities – and even other
   countries – to get out faster and avoid having to file additional years
   of U.S. taxes and potentially steep future tax liabilities.

   “I was concerned about taxes and what would happen to my estate,” said
   Jane (not her real name), a 67-year-old Toronto resident who flew to
   Nassau, Bahamas, in December to renounce rather than wait nearly a year
   in Canada.

   “I couldn’t deal with the unknown,” she said, reluctant to disclose her
   identity while she awaits confirmation from the United States that her
   case is closed.

   A U.S. embassy spokesman would not comment directly on the reasons for
   the long wait times, but he confirmed that it currently takes anywhere
   from 45 days to 10 months to arrange a mandatory meeting, depending on
   the location. He acknowledged that the process is not meant to be easy,
   even as the embassy works to “refine” it.

   “Due to the serious implications the decision to renounce U.S.
   citizenship carries, the process is intended to be deliberative in
   order to permit individuals to reflect upon their decision before
   returning to execute the Oath of Renunciation,” the official said.

   Adding urgency to the rush to leave is a sweeping U.S. law – the
   Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act – that is forcing financial
   institutions around the world to share much more information about
   their U.S. customers. Key disclosure rules take effect this year that
   will make avoiding filing U.S. taxes more difficult.

   The United States appears to be dragging out the renunciation process,
   said Kevyn Nightingale, a tax partner at MNP LLP in Toronto, whose firm
   has done tax filings for nearly 200 clients giving up their U.S.
   citizenship. “There are a lot of consular services being provided to
   Americans abroad. Nothing takes this long,” he said.

   U.S. officials may be embarrassed that their efforts to crack down on
   wealthy tax cheats has instead triggered an exodus of frightened
   middle-class Canadians, Mr. Nightingale suggested. “It does not look
   good to have a lot of Americans renouncing their citizenship because of
   stupid rules – rules that don’t generate significant revenue,” he
   argued.

   Renunciation remains a difficult call for many people because it’s
   complex, unpredictable and often very costly.

   Bob, a 79-year-old retired Ontario doctor who took his renunciation
   oath in December, estimated that he’s spent $50,000 (Canadian) to
   $60,000 in U.S. taxes and fees to lawyers and accountants. Mistakes
   made by a lawyer on his original application dragged out the process
   for more than two years.

   Born in the United States to Canadian parents, he left as an infant and
   lived his entire life in Canada, unaware until recently that he was
   still an American. “It’s been a long, expensive and distressing
   situation,” Bob said, unwilling to identify himself because he has an
   adult child who is still an American.

   Most Canadians typically owe no taxes to the United States because
   taxes here are generally higher. But there are some key differences,
   including capital gains and estate taxes, which can be more onerous in
   the United States. Those who renounce must show they have filed several
   years of back taxes.

   The United States also charges a hefty exit tax on people with a net
   worth of more than $2-million (U.S.) – a penalty that can catch many
   middle-class Canadians with a home or pension. Unlike Canada and
   virtually all other countries, the United States taxes people based on
   citizenship, not residency. That means that Americans must file taxes
   in the United States for their entire lives, regardless of where they
   live.

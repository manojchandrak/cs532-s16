Hayley Atwell Lands Lead in Conviction Legal Drama Pilot at ABC

   TV’s [87]Agent Carter is looking to moonlight, on a very different kind
   of mission.

   [88]Hayley Atwell has landed the lead in Conviction, a drama pilot in
   development at ABC.

   RELATED[89]Pilot Season ’16: Scoop on This Fall’s (Possible) New Shows
   and Stars

   The project will star Atwell as the brilliant-but-rebellious daughter
   of a Clinton-like political family, who is forced into taking a job as
   the head of Los Angeles’ newly created Conviction Integrity Unit. Along
   with her team of lawyers, investigators and forensic experts, she has
   two weeks to examine cases where there’s credible suspicion that the
   wrong person may have been convicted of a crime.

   RELATED[90]Tuesday Ratings: Agent Carter Stabilizes in Week 4

   What does this mean for Agent Carter? In the event that Conviction is
   ordered to series and ABC’s Marvel drama is renewed for Season 3
   (after returning to depressed ratings), TVLine hears that Atwell’s
   schedule would be worked out so that she could do both roles.

   Mark Gordon and Nick Pepper will executive produce the pilot with
   co-creators Liz Friedman and Liz Friedlander. Friedman wrote the pilot,
   and Friedlander will direct.

       cancelled.

                      By the numbers alone, it looks bad. There are a lot
                      of other factors in play including the fact that it
                      is a Marvel show, it has a little bit of a cult
                      following online and since it is a Disney show there
                      are in-house ways costs can be cut.
                      I would guess it will be canceled, but it will not
                      be terribly surprising if it survives.

                           In my mind, *because* it’s a franchise it’s in
                           more danger. They’ll trim the fat and refocus
                           their efforts on the more lucrative aspects.

       The ratings are awful. I love Agent Carter but we should be
       thankful we even got a second season.
       I love Hayley Atwell, and after The Good Wife ends I need a new

            That would be difficult as Hayley has already played an old
            version of the character in Cap and Emily Van Camp’s character
            is supposed to be her descendant.

       Really hoping for an Agent Carter season 3 so glad to already hear
       that she will be able to do both if it does get renewed. This show
       sounds like it could be good too though so it would be great to
       have Hayley leading two shows

       I’m going to need Agent Carter (with Jarvis and Stark) for the rest
       of my life, but I’m glad if it’s renewed then she’ll be able to do
       both roles. It doesn’t really sound like my type of show, but I’m
       glad Hayley is getting more work and I may check it out because I
       have a slight girl crush.

       The new show sounds awful. It seems very similar to a short-lived
       series called In Justice that was really mediocre despite the
       presence of Kyle MacLachlan. I expect cardboard characters with
       little personality and the same old, same old every week. Atwell
       deserves a better premise.

            Never heard of it so I’ll wait to judge what the new show’s
            people actually deliver before judging this isn’t what Attwell
            “deserves”.

            For those who remember that short lived series, MacLachlan’s
            appearances were minimal and the rest of the characters were
            pretty shallow . . . the cases that were investigated weren’t
            all that interesting which only added to its demise. One can
            only hope that lessons were learned from that ‘attempt’ .

       Well, obviously if Agent Carter were to be renewed, it would be for
       the usual reduced amount of episodes as fill-in for SHIELD, so
       presumably that wouldn’t take as long to film as a standard
       22-episode cycle, so she could probably easily do both as long as
       Carter’s renewal would fit its usual episode count.

       I think Michelle Fazeekas and Tara Butters are also working on
       another series in development. I love “Agent Carter ” but I think
       with this news, we’re looking at the end of the series no matter
       what ABC says right now. It’s unfortunate, because this has been a
       consistently good series, with great stories and wonderful acting.
       I often wonder if this show would have done better had it been
       given it’s own timeslot this season, (not against the monster NCIS
       block and made to seem more important by ABC) instead of subbing in
       for AOS. Oh well, at least we got 18 episodes.

                 I don’t think quotes from Dr. Suess will help here, Matt.
                 But thanks for trying. I just get discouraged when good
                 tv doesn’t survive. “Marvel’s Most Wanted” is probably
                 going to be just craptastic, no matter how good Adrianne
                 Palicki is. Maybe they can cast Adrianne as Hayley’s long
                 lost sister in “Conviction” when that fails. Sorry…when I
                 think about the quality of Marvel shows on broadcast
                 network that are gonna be given a chance versus the one
                 they’re dumping, I get frustrated. (Yes, AOS is better,
                 but think of how good it could be if Fazeekas, Butters
                 and their writers were involved.)

       Agent Carter should stay on the air. It’s smart, it’s funny, it has
       a wonderful cast – and I have no idea why all these things haven’t
       attracted more viewers. I guess they’d rather be watching The
       Bachelor or some repetitive crime show that’s been on for fifteen
       years. I do not understand people at all.
       Peggy is one of my favorite characters not only in the MCU, but
       ever, and to lose her would just be a crying shame. She’s strong,
       fearless, caring, funny, clever, and intelligent, and we need more
       women like her on TV and in the movies, certainly not less. If ABC
       takes her away from us, at least let Netflix save her!

       I really like Agent Carter, so I hope it is renewed. They need to
       advertise more.

       So happy for her. I love Hayley Atwell, and this show sounds
       interesting and different, so I’m in. I’d be even happier if this
       show got picked up AND Agent Carter got renewed, but that’s
       probably pushing it.

       I’m so torn….on one hand I love Hayley Atwell and want her to be
       super successful! on the other hand I love Peggy Carter and want to
       watch it forever!! She’s my fave female marvel character-maybe just
       fave character!!:)

       they better keep her character british, i would be heartbroken if
       she does this role with an american accent.

       I am glad to have Hayley in another series but hope this is not a
       bad sign for Agent Carter. So much fun and a great S2 so far – I’m
       all #TeamRose :-)

       For those who’ve never seen Agent Carter, it’s a dramaty with
       emphasis on comedy. Peggy Cater can be badass, difference being she
       does it wearing skirts. The exception is S2,ep5 which was
       hilariously hysterical from the scene right out of “Gun a fight At
       The OK Corral” to the 1940’s song “put that pistol down boy,” to
       Peggy zapping that Letcher 3 or t extra times knowing it could
       cause brain damage or the look on Rose’s face looking to take out a
       second thug.

            the most interesting people in Mumbrella's world. Today we

            Total Brand Activation. MORNING: Up at 6:30am I write down my
            idea for a new project before it evaporates. It’s for a
            vehicle launch: the ground rumbles and an off-road vehicle

            outback in front of the guests. Now, how to make that happen…

            account[29] george photios After media agency Carat admitted
            Virgin Australia's tweet telling Kanye West to 'EAD' came
            about as a result of an error by a junior staff member George
            Photios looks at how companies can avoid the same thing
            happening to them. There have been plenty of misfires on
            social recently, [30]the most recent being Virgin's overtly
            honest tweet to Kanye West. However, with users having access
            to so many accounts across so many properties it's easy to
            post the wrong content to the wrong page. Whether you're from
            within an agency posting to multiple clients' accounts, or
            working client-side on multiple properties, it can get quite
            confusing. But there are a few simple processes which can
            remove much of the risk.

            the era of media convergence?[32] Kate Edwards
            In this guest post, Kate Edwards asks whether the current
            arguments around media fragmentation and ownership are
            an opportunity to create regional-only unique content.  To say
            today's media landscape is a challenging environment is
            possibly the understatement of this generation of marketing
            and advertising professionals. It's not since the launch of
            colour TV in 1956 that industry has been on such a high speed
            high risk and high reward ride.

            decade Chris Chapman has led the media watchdog as it
            attempted to navigate an increasingly complex landscape. A
            fortnight before he finishes up in the role Chapman sat down
            with Nic Christensen to talk about his legacy and the future
            of the regulator.  Ask senior people in the broadcast industry
            for their view on ACMA boss Chris Chapman and it is
            immediately apparent there is no-one who is ambivalent.
          + [35]Has the media set up depression as a justifiable excuse
            for people's mistakes?[36] Oliver Shawyer In this guest post
            Oliver Shawyer says the media needs to think carefully about
            its reporting around people's actions and linking them to
            depression. This morning I was asked about my thoughts
            regarding the [37]Gary Lyon situation. Not because I know
            anything about Gary Lyon and not because I'm an AFL fan, but
            because I suffer from depression and have worked tirelessly in
            my own way to help break down the stigma of the mental illness
            by telling my story. Now before you decide this piece isn’t
            for you, it's worth pointing out that I'm not actually here to
            talk about the Gary Lyon situation. I'm here to talk about the
            people writing about the Gary Lyon situation.

            new OzTAM catch-up TV data. Nic Christensen breaks down what
            the numbers mean and how they should be interpreted.  It's in
            part a sign of how eager the TV networks were for accurate
            online audience figures that [41]both Seven and Ten yesterday
            decided that "close enough is good enough" and unfairly
            inflated their total TV audience figures.

            body. Miranda Ward sat down with new president Jennifer Muir
            to find out what the future holds. The past few years have
            proven difficult for Australia’s oldest professional body for
            PR professionals, losing money, members and relevance. The
            industry has changed apace, but the Public Relations Institute

            Aegis has undergone a sudden and dramatic leadership
            transition [46]with Luke Littlefield being replaced by Simon

            Australia's second-largest holding group and what it means for
            its agencies, clients and the media industry alike.  It's hard
            to think of a man more different to Harold Mitchell than Luke
            Littlefield. When [47]Harold Mitchell left in 2013,
            Littlefield - a finance guy and CFO by background - was
            installed to replaced the man who had quite literally learnt
            the media buying business as he simultaneously built it.

            the marketing field the term ‘expert’ gets attached to a lot
            of people who haven't actually earned it argues Tym Yee. In an
            ideal world we’d all be leading experts in our fields. We’d
            spend most of our time contributing to the latest research,
            reading up on breaking news, innovating with technology in

            biggest B2B publisher?[53] reed business information logo
            abbreviated Five years ago it was Australia's leading business
            publisher milking a digital directories cash cow, but under
            private equity owners the business has been stripped out and
            sold-off. In this special report, Steve Jones charts the
            dramatic transformation at the publisher once known as Reed
            Business Information. For some years now, publishing companies
            large and small have been grappling with one fundamental
            issue: how to replace dwindling advertising dollars with new
            revenue streams. No-one has been immune. And in the B2B space,
            few have undergone such a dramatic transformation, or
            epitomised the quest to find digital answers to the publishing
            conundrum, as Reed Business Information (RBI), the
            once-dominant force of trade magazine publishing in Australia.

            behind the move and the odds of the regional TV player being
            successful.  I’m willing to bet Bruce Gordon isn’t the first
            media mogul to dream of switching off the internet. But he
            is among [57]the first to demand that major cities and towns,
            outside of the five main metropolitan areas, have their access

Quickflix looks to restructure Stan’s shares in business claiming it is
putting off investors

   [65]Quickflix Australia’s first streaming service Quickflix is trying
   to get rival Stan to restructure a massive share block it holds in the
   business, claiming it is putting off new investors as it seeks a new
   round of capital raising.

   In 2014 Stan, owned by Nine Entertainment and Fairfax Media, [66]bought
   a $1m shareholding from US cable giant HBO which also came with a
   series of warrants and covenants effectively blocking Quickflix from
   being sold without the new owners paying more than $10.5m to Stan.

   Quickflix today put out a statement to the Australian Securities
   Exchange saying it was now looking to “restructure” Stan’s shares as it
   goes into yet another round of capital-raising from investors claiming
   they are “a significant disincentive for incoming investors”.

RELATED: [67]Why Nine’s investment in Quickflix makes it tougher for Netflix
to launch in Australia

   At the end of last month [68]Quickflix filed its latest accounts (ASX:
   QFX) which showed the company has just $659,000 cash on hand and had
   seen a 22% fall in subscriber numbers for the quarter.

   On Christmas Eve it [69]also snuck out an announcement that it had
   restructured $7.5m owed to major studios for licensing agreements,
   while last month CEO Stephen Langsford told Mumbrella the business was
   pivoting away from streaming to concentrate on its still profitable DVD
   delivery and on-demand movie businesses.

   In today’s statement, Quickflix said: “In order to progress its
   restructure and raise new capital, Quickflix is therefore seeking to
   reach agreement with Stan for the immediate restructuring of the RPS.”

   Quickflick’s market cap on the ASX is $2.22m.

   According to the statement, Stan’s holding must also legally be
   recorded as a debt of $11.6m on the Quickflix books.

   It adds: “Whilst Stan can only ask for redemption of the RPS
   (redeemable preference shares) in limited circumstances, the company
   will rank behind the RPS.”

   Stan has been approached for comment.

       It feels like there is an element of schadenfreude to Mumbrella’s
       reporting on Quickflix. Many other Australian businesses are
       struggling, but not so well reported.

       kudos to the entrepreneurs not wanting to walk away, but at some
       point, you’ve got to admit failure. lick your wounds, and move on.
       no shame in it.

       Hi K,
       We take no pleasure in reporting on any struggling business, but
       these are important stories that need to be told accurately and
       fully.
       Quickflix also has continuous disclosure obligations under its ASX
       listing, which puts a lot more info out about it than most
       struggling companies.
       Cheers,
       Alex – editor, Mumbrella

       How is Quickflix still even a thing currently? If it was a dog it
       would have been put down a long time ago.

       Stans position has absolutely no relevance for attracting
       investment. Of greater importance is the festering carcass of a
       business that was quickflix, an entity that only a retarded monkey
       with an innate ability to lose millions would consider tipping more
       cash into.

       I completely agree K. I’ve been following the streaming wars as an
       unbiased non investor and reading almost all the articles that go
       with it. I don’t think I could predict the outcome of quickflix
       with the absolute certainty that others seem to have. Quickflix
       survives and many will eat their words.

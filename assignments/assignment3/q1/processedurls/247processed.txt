   Thursday’s byelection was triggered when Christine Elliott resigned the
   seat in the summer, ending a mini-family dynasty.
   By: The Canadian Press, Published on Wed Feb 10 2016

   WHITBY, ONT.—A provincial byelection east of Toronto should, on the
   face of it, be the Progressive Conservatives’ to lose, but several
   factors are making for a tougher fight — and a more interesting race.

   Byelections [78]can often be unfriendly toward the governing party, and
   not only are two criminal cases before the courts over alleged Liberal
   activities, but the Liberals’ partial sell-off of Hydro One to pay for
   infrastructure has proven widely unpopular.

   As well, Whitby-Oshawa is a longtime Tory riding and candidate Lorne
   Coe — a regional councillor already known in the community — has the
   support of the popular previous MPP, Christine Elliott.

   Thursday’s byelection was triggered when Elliott resigned the seat in
   the summer, [79]ending a mini-family dynasty. Her husband, the late Jim
   Flaherty, represented the area provincially from 1995 to 2006, when he
   jumped to federal politics, and Elliott took up the banner, holding the
   seat until she stepped down.

   That’s where the Liberals see an opportunity.

   It’s the first time in decades the Liberals “have a real shot” at
   winning Whitby-Oshawa, said Liberal candidate Elizabeth Roy.

   “Some would say it was or is a Conservative riding, but others argue it
   was a Jim and Christine riding,” she said.

   Since Elliott’s resignation came after losing the Progressive
   Conservative leadership race to Patrick Brown, it is splitting some PC
   allegiances in Whitby-Oshawa.

   “We’re hearing a lot at the doors about Christine Elliott,” Roy said.
   “Community members are upset she wasn’t chosen as leader of the party.”

   NDP candidate Niki Lundquist is hearing the same things from voters.

   “There is no question that Christine Elliott and Jim Flaherty were very
   personally popular and I think that actually helped in terms of
   Conservative support,” she said.

   “People are unsure of Patrick Brown. They don’t know a lot about him.
   They don’t know what he is and they also feel genuinely that Christine
   Elliott would have been a better leader, so I think there are many
   Conservative supporters who are not clear on what they should be doing
   in this election.”

   But even with the popular Elliott’s support — she nominated Coe for the
   party’s candidate — she has not been a public presence on the campaign
   trail since she was appointed by the Liberals in December as the
   province’s patient ombudsman, a politically neutral position.

   Coe still tends to mention her within the first five seconds of
   knocking on someone’s door.

   “Christine did come to the nomination meeting and spoke about ... the
   values that I would bring as a Progressive, and I underscore
   progressive, Conservative and my abilities to continue the legacy that
   her late husband and she brought to this riding for 20 years,” he said.

   In a sign of just how much the Liberals are hoping Elliott’s
   resignation left a hole they can fill, they had Prime Minister
   [80]Justin Trudeau and his “sunny ways” refrain sweep into town Tuesday
   night for a rally.

   He reminded Liberals packed into a Whitby restaurant that “Ontario now
   has an ambitious and dedicated partner in Ottawa.”

   It may help Roy’s pitch to voters that not only would she be their
   voice in government — as opposed to voting as an opposition MPP — but
   that her party has a powerful friend in Ottawa.

   All three of the major candidates nearly agree on what issues are top
   of mind for Whitby-Oshawa residents: jobs, health care, infrastructure
   and transit, as many of them commute to Toronto for work. Rising hydro
   rates are also a concern, highlighted by a group of protesters outside
   Tuesday’s Trudeau rally.

Meditation and aerobic exercise done together helps reduce depression, according
                                 to a new study

      February 10, 2016 by Robin Lally

   [8]Meditation and aerobic exercise done together helps reduce
   depression, according to a new Rutgers study.
   A combined program of meditation and exercise can reduce depression,
   according to a Rutgers study

   The study, published in Translational Psychiatry this month, found that
   the mind and body combination – done twice a week for only two months –
   reduced the symptoms for a group of students by 40 percent.

   "We are excited by the findings because we saw such a meaningful
   improvement in both clinically depressed and non-depressed students,"
   says Brandon Alderman, lead author of the research study. "It is the
   first time that both of these two behavioral therapies have been looked
   at together for dealing with depression."

   Alderman, assistant professor in the Department of Exercise Science and
   Sports Studies, and Tracey Shors, professor in the Department of
   Psychology and Center for Collaborative Neuroscience, both in the
   School of Arts and Sciences, discovered that a combination of mental
   and physical training (MAP) enabled students with [9]major depressive
   disorder not to let problems or negative thoughts overwhelm them.

   "Scientists have known for a while that both of these activities alone
   can help with depression," says Shors. "But this study suggests that
   when done together, there is a striking improvement in [10]depressive
   symptoms along with increases in synchronized brain activity."

   The men and women in the Rutgers study who completed the eight-week
   program – 22 suffering with depression and 30 mentally healthy students
   – reported fewer depressive symptoms and said they did not spend as
   much time worrying about negative situations taking place in their
   lives as they did before the study began.

   [11]Meditation and aerobic exercise done together helps reduce
   depression, according to a new Rutgers study.

   Aerobic excercise done in conjunction with meditation can help reduce
   negative thoughts.

   This group also provided MAP training to young mothers who had been
   homeless but were living at a residential treatment facility when they
   began the study. The women involved in the research exhibited severe
   depressive symptoms and elevated anxiety levels at the beginning. But
   at the end of the eight weeks, they too, reported that their depression
   and anxiety had eased, they felt more motivated, and they were able to
   focus more positively on their lives.

   Depression – a debilitating disorder that affects nearly one in five
   Americans sometime in their life – often occurs in adolescence or young
   adulthood. Until recently, Rutgers scientists say, the most common
   treatment for depression has been psychotropic medications that
   influence brain chemicals and regulate emotions and thought patterns
   along with talk therapy that can work but takes considerable time and
   commitment on the part of the patient.

   [INS: :INS]

   Rutgers researchers say those who participated in the study began with
   30 minutes of focused attention meditation followed by 30 minutes of
   aerobic exercise. They were told that if their thoughts drifted to the
   past or the future they should refocus on their breathing – enabling
   those with depression to accept moment-to-moment changes in attention.

   Shors, who studies the production of new brain cells in the hippocampus
   – the portion of the brain known to be necessary for some types of new
   learning – says even though neurogenesis cannot be monitored in humans,
   scientists have shown in animal models that [12]aerobic exercise
   increases the number of new neurons and effortful learning keeps a
   significant number of those cells alive.

   The idea for the human intervention came from her laboratory studies,
   she says, with the main goal of helping individuals acquire new skills
   so that they can learn to recover from [13]stressful life events. By
   learning to focus their attention and exercise, people who are fighting
   [14]depression can acquire new cognitive skills that can help them
   process information and reduce the overwhelming recollection of
   memories from the past, Shors says.

   "We know these therapies can be practiced over a lifetime and that they
   will be effective in improving mental and cognitive health," says
   Alderman. "The good news is that this intervention can be practiced by
   anyone at any time and at no cost."

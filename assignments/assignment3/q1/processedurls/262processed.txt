   Daenerys Targaryen of "Game of Thrones" is plotting ways to get more
   people to join HBO Now.
   HBO

   People seem to love HBO's "Game of Thrones" and "Girls." But maybe not
   that much if they have to pay to watch them.

   HBO Now, the premium channel's online-only subscription service, was
   expected to be a big hit with people who are cutting back on cable
   subscriptions, but adoption of the new service for now looks to be
   underwhelming. The channel's CEO mentioned on a call with analysts
   Wednesday that HBO Now has brought in about 800,000 subscribers so far,
   well below the lofty predictions for the service.

   With Wall Street [121]expectations as high as 2 million subscribers,
   HBO chief Richard Plepler was forced on the defensive.

   "I wouldn't say only 800,000 HBO Now subs," he said on the call,
   responding an analyst's question about the lower-than-predicted number.
   "We're just getting started, I think we're going to make a lot of
   progress as we put new content on and get onto new platforms."

   HBO Now launched in April amid expectations that more consumers are
   dropping or cutting back on their cable packages and instead cobbling
   together their daily video entertainment with online options like
   YouTube and Netflix. Hoping to entice these so-called cord-cutters and
   perhaps tamp down online piracy of its shows, HBO came out with the
   standalone service for $15 a month, the same price as with a cable
   subscription. The fact that HBO Now isn't growing as fast as expected
   could mean that major shift in consumer habits is moving slower than
   predicted, or perhaps HBO isn't as popular with cord-cutters as many
   thought.

   Still, Plepler may have a point, since the service's roll out took
   time. HBO Now was available exclusively on Apple devices for its first
   three months of existence. It came to Google's Chromecast and Amazon
   Fire devices in August, then reached Roku's streaming devices in
   October. Plepler said HBO Now still needs to launch on Sony's
   PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox, which he said account for 20 percent
   of viewing on HBO Go, the channel's streaming service that's only
   available with a pay-TV subscription.

   On top of that, he said HBO still hasn't launched a handful of new
   shows that should draw in more cord-cutters. Those shows include
   projects from Jon Stewart and Bill Simmons, as well as a daily news
   show from Vice. HBO also plans to market HBO Now more aggressively,
   which should also boost subscriptions.

   "I think we've made a lot of progress," Plepler said, later adding, "We
   see an enormous opportunity ahead."

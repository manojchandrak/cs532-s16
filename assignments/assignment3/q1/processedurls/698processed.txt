   New survey on timber industry skills shortage
   Published:  26 January, 2016

   The Confederation of Timber Industry (CTI) and Proskills have launched
   an employer skill survey into the UK's timber industry supply chain.

   The research aims to identify the current level of skills shortages and
   gaps in education provision within the whole timber industry Supply
   Chain, from forestry to builders' merchants and manufacturers. It will
   be distributed to businesses and other interested parties through trade
   associations, research institutes and training providers operating in
   the UK.

   Through the survey, CTI and Proskills aims to map current education
   providers delivering to the sector, highlighting gaps between supply
   and demand. Similarly, the research will identify areas of strength and
   excellence offering a catalyst for the engagement of the industry in
   improving skills, recruitment and training.

   The collected data will be summarised in a report, indicating
   priorities and needed actions, to be published in the spring of 2016.
   The CTI will present the findings to government, stakeholders and key
   opinion makers in order to shape the political agenda on education and
   skills.

   Succession planning for an ageing workforce and gaps in provision are
   issues which need to be addressed. Few young people decide to choose
   timber as a career option, as repeatedly outlined by trade
   organisations, training providers and companies. This issue is
   exacerbated by the limited offer of further education courses,
   apprenticeships and craft qualifications that affects the growth of the
   whole sector.

   "This survey represents a great opportunity for the timber industries
   to express their views about skills needs," said Dirk Vennix, CTI chief
   executive. "Improving skills and education is a key target of CTI's
   three-year strategic plan and, along with our members, we intend to
   encourage young people to go for a career in the timber sector.
   Depending on the outcomes of the survey this could include supporting
   the launch of new timber related courses as well as helping increase
   the number of apprenticeships and developing an ambassadorial schools
   network across the supply chain."

   The survey is accessible online [6]here or through a printable version,
   downloadable [7]here.

   The deadline for submissions is 5 February 2016.

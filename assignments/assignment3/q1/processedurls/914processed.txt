Twitter's User Growth Stalls for the Second Quarter in a Row

   But revenue meets expectations By [28]Marty Swant

     * [29]Technology

   Twitter had 320 million users on the platform as of the fourth quarter
   of 2015. Periscope

   Twitter didn't fly very high in the fourth quarter of 2015. The San
   Francisco-based company, already facing pressure to grow its user base
   and value, didn't gain users, though its revenue did meet analysts'
   expectations.

   According to Twitter's earnings statement, total monthly active users
   remained at 320 million in the fourth quarter—the [30]same number it
   had the previous quarter. Total MAUs in the U.S. actually fell
   slightly, from 66 million to 65 million, while international users
   stayed at about 254 million. Year-over-year user growth increased by 9
   percent in the fourth quarter, and mobile users now make up 80 percent
   of all MAUs.

   After its quarterly earnings were released, the company posted this
   tweet:

     As of the end of January, we've seen MAUs return to Q3 levels.
     Confident in continued growth with disciplined execution. [31]#TWTR
     — TwitterIR (@TwitterIR) [32]February 10, 2016

   Revenue totaled $710 million for the quarter, a 48 percent increase
   over the fourth quarter of 2014. Advertising revenue was $641
   million—$410 million from the U.S.—with 86 percent of that figure
   coming from mobile.

   "We made significant progress in scaling the total number of active
   advertisers to 130,000 in Q4, up almost [90 percent] year over year,"
   the company said in a statement. "It's remarkable we built this
   business in just five years from zero revenue. We saw a decline in
   monthly active usage in Q4, but we've already seen January monthly
   actives bounce back to Q3 levels. We're confident that, with
   disciplined execution, this growth trend will continue over time."

   Earlier in the day, [33]Twitter introduced a new algorithm that
   reorders tweets at the top of users' timelines based on their activity,
   interests and network. While user reactions were mixed, [34]agency
   executives say they're optimistic about the potential for relevant and
   popular content to be promoted above the traditional
   reverse-chronological news feed.

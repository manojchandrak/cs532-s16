   The hot streak has pushed the Celtics into third place in the Eastern
   Conference with the All-Star break coming up this weekend.

   The Celtics hit the road for a game against (20-32) Milwaukee tonight,
   looking to stretch the winning streak to five games. Boston is 15-12 on
   the road this season.

   For more on the game, GoLocal teams up with Graphiq.

Tommy and or Max

   Whether you watch the games on TV or listen on the radio, or maybe a
   combination of both, you get to hear legends in Tommy Heinsohn and
   Cedric Maxwell.

   Both offer insightful analysis while neither shows any love to the
   referees.

   That's a "Tommy Point"

R.J. Hunter

   The Celtics selected 6'6"guard R.J. Hunter with the 28th pick in this
   past summers NBA Draft out of Georgia State. Hunter averaged a career
   high 20 points and five rebounds per game for the Panthers.

   Hunter is best known for his shot in the NCAA Tournament that helped
   Georgia State beat Baylor in the first round, and also saw his father
   fall off of his seat.

   Hunter could turn out to be one of the steals of the NBA Draft as he is
   a good shooter, something that the Celtics need.

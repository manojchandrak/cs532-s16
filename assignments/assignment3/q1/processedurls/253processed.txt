   FERGUSON, MO. -- The Department of Justice is suing Ferguson, Missouri,
   alleging a pattern of unconstitutional policing.

   CBS News

   Attorney General Lynch and the head of the Department of Justice Civil
   Rights Division announced the legal action against Ferguson, Missouri,
   on Wednesday during a press conference.

   This comes [57]after Ferguson failed to fully approve to the agreement
   reached with the DOJ to resolve unconstitutional policing and court
   systems in the city.

   Lynch said Ferguson's decision to reject the agreement left the
   department no choice except to sue.

   "The residents of Ferguson have waited nearly a year for the city to
   adopt an agreement that would protect their rights and keep them safe.
   ... They have waited decades for justice. They should not be forced to
   wait any longer."

Ferguson commission report calls for reforms

   A commission appointed by the governor of Missouri issued a report
   Monday calling for sweeping reforms that address poverty as well as
   policing. ...

   Ferguson has been under Justice Department scrutiny since
   [58]18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed, was fatally
   shot by white officer Darren Wilson 18 months ago. A grand jury and the
   Justice Department declined to prosecute Wilson, who resigned in
   November 2014.

   But a scathing Justice Department report was critical of police and a
   profit-driven municipal court system. Following months of negotiations,
   an agreement between the federal agency and Ferguson was announced in
   January.

   A recent financial analysis determined the agreement would cost the
   struggling city nearly $4 million in the first year alone. The council
   voted 6-0 Tuesday to adopt the deal, but with seven amendments.

   Hours before the lawsuit was to be announced, Ferguson leaders said
   they were willing to sit down with Justice Department negotiators and
   hammer out a new agreement.

   "We ask that if they (the Justice Department) feel there needs to be
   some additional changes to the agreement, we sit down and talk,"
   Knowles said.

   That seemed unlikely from the outset. Within hours of the Tuesday vote,
   Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division,
   said in a statement that the department would take "the necessary legal
   actions" to ensure Ferguson's police and court practices comply with
   the Constitution and federal laws.

   Knowles said the seven amendments were formulated after the analysis
   showed the deal was so expensive it could lead to dissolution of
   Ferguson. The analysis suggested that the first-year cost of the
   agreement would be $2.2 million to $3.7 million, with second- and
   third-year costs between $1.8 million and $3 million in each year.

   Ten year Ferguson resident Aisha Jordan told CBS News' Vinita Nair the
   price tag of the agreement is less than the cost of doing nothing.

   So much of this seems to be around money, "Yeah, and I do understand
   you know, because I am living it, we are all living it but at the end
   of the day we have to do what is right," she said.

   Ferguson has an operating budget of $14.5 million and already faces a
   $2.8 million deficit. Voters will be asked to approve two tax hikes in
   April, but approval of both would still leave the city short.

   A big part of the cost was the requirement that Ferguson raise police
   salaries to attract better candidates, including more minority
   officers. Removal of the pay-raise clause was among the seven
   amendments.

   Another new provision states that the agreement will not apply to any
   other governmental entity that might take over duties currently
   provided by Ferguson. That means, for example, that St. Louis County
   would not be beholden to the agreement if it takes over policing in
   Ferguson.

Ferguson: One year later

   Protesters marked the one-year anniversary of Michael Brown's shooting
   death and the peaceful vigils turned violent

   St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said if the county
   were ever asked to take over policing in Ferguson, "we would consider
   the implications of the consent decree before entering into such an
   agreement."

   Knowles doesn't believe neighboring municipal departments would agree
   to cover Ferguson under the Justice Department's requirements.

   Ferguson's defiance to the initial proposal wasn't surprising.

   Days after Brown's death, then-Police Chief Tom Jackson released
   surveillance video showing Brown's involvement in a theft at a small
   grocery store just moments before the shooting, with the burly teenager
   pushing the store owner. The video's release only heightened anger
   among protesters.

   Knowles has vigorously defended Ferguson. Even as protesters and civil
   rights leaders called for reforms, the mayor noted that Ferguson was
   already making changes to municipal courts aimed at easing the burden
   on people accused of minor violations. In fact, city revenue from court
   fees and fines has declined by hundreds of thousands of dollars since
   the shooting.

   Messages seeking comment from Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III were not
   immediately returned.

   It's not uncommon for local governments to seek changes to agreements
   even after negotiations, but the overwhelming majority of
   investigations still end up in a settlement.

   Samuel Bagenstos, the former No. 2 official at the Justice Department's
   Civil Rights Division, warned that the federal agency "is serious about
   bringing a lawsuit if they don't get a deal."

   "If Ferguson insists on making significant changes to the deal they've
   already worked out, that's probably not going to work out well for
   them," said Bagenstos, now a law professor at the University of
   Michigan. "And I think at the end of the day, Ferguson understands
   that, and we'll probably see a deal pretty soon."

   The Justice Department has initiated more than 20 civil rights
   investigations into law enforcement agencies in the last six years,
   including in Baltimore and Chicago. In the last 18 months, the
   department has reached settlements with police departments that
   included Cleveland and Albuquerque.

   There have been occasional disagreements.

   In 2012, the Justice Department sued Maricopa County, Arizona, after
   failing to reach agreement on allegations that the sheriff's office
   targeted Latinos with discriminatory stops and arrests. County
   officials voted in July to settle parts of that lawsuit.

   The federal government also sued North Carolina's Alamance County
   following an investigation that alleged biased policing practices
   against Latinos there. But a federal judge last August ruled in the
   county's favor, saying the Justice Department failed to prove the
   sheriff ordered deputies to target Hispanic residents. That case is on
   appeal.

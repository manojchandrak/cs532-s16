   Anthony Vito Brancatella was sentenced to a maximum term of 40 months
   behind bars with a non-parole period of 20 months, Fairfax Media
   reported.

   Consumer Affairs Victoria found 62 breaches between December 2013 and
   June 2014 when Brancatella siphoned money from the trust account of his
   agency, McDonald Real Estate in Mulgrave, to help sustain his ailing
   business.

   More than $500,000 in compensation has been paid to 12 of his victims
   through the Victorian Property Fund, and Brancatella had personally
   reimbursed almost $400,000.

   County Judge Carolyn Douglas said the offences were out of character
   and noted Brancatella’s desperation due to his agency’s financial
   struggles.

   “Unfortunately, your offending can tarnish all of those working in the
   real estate industry,” Judge Douglas said.

   “In the circumstances, I take into account in your favour that you’ve
   lost your livelihood in that you’re no longer able to work in your
   chosen job,” she added.

   Judge Douglas acknowledged Brancatella’s early admission of guilt,
   willingness to co-operate with investigators and reimburse those
   affected in handing him a reduced sentence.

   Brancatella’s licence was suspended in March 2015 by Consumer Affairs
   Victoria.

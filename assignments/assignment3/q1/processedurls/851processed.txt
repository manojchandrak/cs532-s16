Coming Soon: Nation's First HIV-Positive Organ Transplants

Johns Hopkins plans to pave the way for HIV-positive patients to receive an
organ from an HIV-positive donor.

   As soon as the right match becomes available, Johns Hopkins plans to
   become the first U.S. hospital to perform organ transplants between
   HIV-positive donors and recipients who have the virus – forging a path
   that could cut down on those waiting for an organ donation and increase
   the nation's transplant rate.

   Dr. Dorry Segev, director of the Epidemiology Research Group in Organ
   Transplantation at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, estimates
   about 1,000 organs from about 500 viable potential donors with HIV are
   wasted each year.

   "If [these organs are given to HIV-positive patients], it will be the
   largest increase in transplantation in the last decade," Segev tells
   U.S. News.

   pediatric double hand transplant surgery at the Children’s Hospital of
   Philadelphia.

   Patients with HIV already could receive organs from donors without the
   virus. In 2013, President Barack Obama signed the [33]HIV Organ Policy
   Equity – or HOPE – Act, which Segev helped draft and made transplants
   between HIV-positive donors and recipients legal for the first time
   since 1988.

   Such procedures would shorten the waiting list for everyone, Segev
   says. Right now, there are about [34]120,000 people in line for a
   transplant.

   The hospital would perform kidney and liver transplants and initially
   focus on deceased donors, [35]The New York Times reports. It would be
   the first in the country to perform an HIV-positive kidney transplant;
   an [36]HIV-positive liver transplant would be the first in the world.

   The initiative is seen as a victory in the HIV community, not only
   because people with the disease will have more medical options, but
   because they will have a chance to donate as well.

   "The idea that my organs could now benefit someone living with HIV?
   Heck yeah," Michael Kaplan, president of the AIDS United lobbying group
   and someone who has been living with AIDS for years, told [37]the
   Times.

   Although Johns Hopkins is currently the first and only hospital in the
   U.S. approved to perform the transplants, Segev says it is working with
   other hospitals to help them get permissions and protocols in place.

   Finds]

   Some medical officials reportedly [39]expressed concerns in the past
   that HIV-related infections could be transmitted through the
   transplants and that organs from HIV-positive donors could be
   transplanted to patients without the virus by accident.

   But Johns Hopkins has worked for two years to nail down policies with
   key health organizations to keep the process safe, Segev says.

   "While it's exciting for Hopkins to have achieved this policy victory
   and to be able to do this innovative work, the real excitement is for
   the patients who now have the opportunity to have their lives saved,"
   he says.

The deceased brother-in-law of NFL quarterback Jay Cutler was paranoid about

   By BRADY McCOMBS, Associated Press

   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The brother-in-law of NFL quarterback Jay Cutler
   was paranoid about being followed by gang members when he crashed his
   car in a remote part of Utah and wandered off to his death in frigid
   temperatures, according to police reports obtained Wednesday by The
   Associated Press.

   Michael Cavallari — the brother of reality TV personality Kristin
   Cavallari — was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was a heavy online
   gambler who struggled with alcohol abuse, investigative reports say.

   Cavallari had recently been arrested on weapons charges in California
   and was being evicted from his apartment in the days before he left his
   home and embarked on a cross-country road trip over the Thanksgiving
   weekend.

   His death was ruled accidental by a Utah state medical examiner who
   said an autopsy found he died from hypothermia, authorities revealed
   Tuesday.

   Cavallari's body was found at the bottom of a steep hillside filled
   with boulders on Dec. 10, about two weeks after his abandoned car was
   found an estimated 200 miles south of Salt Lake City. Investigators
   found the 2014 Honda Civic with the engine running, radio blaring, air
   bag deployed, clothes filling the back seat and $18,000 in cash inside
   a golf bag in the trunk, the documents show.

   Family members told Grand County Sheriff's investigators that Michael
   Cavallari had recently inherited $24,000 from his grandmother's estate.
   He earned $8,000 a month working for his father's company in a division
   of management and leasing of apartment complexes.

   His mother told investigators that her son had been diagnosed with
   bipolar disorder and had become paranoid.

   Michael Cavallari had told family that gang members in Los Angeles were
   after him because of the girl he was dating. His father said his son
   might have fled California because of the perceived threat.

   It's not known if he had any drugs or alcohol in his system the night
   he drove his car off the dirt road. Grand County Sheriff Steven White
   said Wednesday they are waiting on toxicology reports from the medical
   examiner's office.

   Michael Cavallari had been arrested in California four days earlier on
   allegations that he acted threateningly toward a woman and had a gun.
   He bailed out of jail on Nov. 25.

   Michael Cavallari was supposed to spend Thanksgiving with his father in
   the San Clemente area of California, but his dad said his son was
   instead in Durango, Colorado, that day. Witnesses in nearby Grand
   Junction, Colorado, told investigators that Cavallari stopped at a park
   there and asked for directions.

   Cavallari was last seen on security-camera footage at a convenience
   store in Monticello, Utah, on Nov. 27 — hours before a rancher found
   his abandoned car near a dirt road.

   Early in the investigation, his father asked authorities to avoid
   telling the media about his son being missing because of the celebrity
   status of some family members. The Grand County Sheriff eventually
   issued a news release on Dec. 4 in an effort to attract more
   information and leads.

   Deputies spent several days searching the remote and rocky area for
   Cavallari — sending teams on foot, ATV and in helicopter to comb the
   region. Deputies were also sent to Cavallari's home in California to
   talk with neighbors, police and family.

   Kristin Cavallari rose to fame in the mid-2000s when she appeared in
   the MTV reality series "Laguna Beach" and "The Hills." She is married
   to Cutler, who starred at Vanderbilt University and now plays for the
   Chicago Bears. She denied comment through a publicist.

   Investigators reached the conclusion that Cavallari may have left the
   warmth and safety of his car that cold night because of his "paranoid
   state" and belief that "he was being followed by unknown persons with
   harmful intent."

Horses Can Read Human Facial Expressions, New Study Suggests

If you've got a long face, a horse might notice.

   [83]Horses are able to distinguish between at least some human facial
   expressions, suggests a new study by researchers at the U.K.’s
   University of Sussex.

   In the study, published in the February edition of Biology Letters,
   researchers examined the reactions of 28 horses, from five different
   stables, to large photos that showed a man either smiling or making an
   angry expression.
   [56bba67f1a00009c01ab26ac.jpeg?cache=b5qebaon6u] Portra Images via
   Getty Images Horses' heart rates increased at a faster rate when they
   viewed photos of an angry facial expression.

   "We found that when we presented the photograph to the horses, they
   really paid attention and engaged with the facial expression images,
   partly because this is quite a novel situation for them," lead
   researcher Amy Smith told The Huffington Post in an email. "Responses
   to real-life humans are likely to be more subtle, because they are more
   accustomed to these interactions."

   When the horses viewed the angry images, their heart rates sped up more
   quickly, researchers found. Horses were also more likely to turn and
   look at the angry faces with their left eye -- a reaction that the
   researchers wrote is “generally associated with stimulus perceived as
   negative.” The [84]theory behind this "left gaze bias" is that the
   brain's right hemisphere is specially equipped to help process negative
   emotions.

   "It's interesting to note that the horses had a strong reaction to the
   negative expressions but less so to the positive,” Smith [85]said in a
   news release. “This may be because it is particularly important for
   animals to recognize threats in their environment. In this context,
   recognizing angry faces may act as a warning system, allowing horses to
   anticipate negative human behavior such as rough handling."

   However, the horses were also being shown photos of strangers, and
   researchers noted in the paper that the animals may have had stronger
   responses to the happy faces if they were familiar with the people
   pictured. Dogs, for instance, have better human facial expression
   recognition when viewing their owners, or people of the same gender as
   their owners, the paper notes.

   The new study builds on previous work by some of the same researchers,
   who published a paper last year documenting how [86]horses communicate
   their own emotions through facial expressions.

   "Emotional awareness is likely to be very important in highly social
   species like horses -- and ongoing research in our lab is examining the
   relationship between a range of emotional skills and social behavior,"
   Smith told HuffPost.

   Cavalo Crioulo (in Portuguese) or Caballo Criollo (in Spanish), is the
   native horse of Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and Paraguay. It may
   have the best endurance of any horse breed in the world next to the
   Arabian. In fact, due to the criollo?s low basal metabolism, it may be
   a better long-distance horse than the Arabian in prolonged races over a
   week in duration with no supplemental feed.

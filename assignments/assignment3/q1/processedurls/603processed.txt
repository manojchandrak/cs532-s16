[24]In New Hampshire exit polls, a tale of woe for Hillary Clinton

   Hillary Clinton's bracing 22-point defeat in New Hampshire came at the
   hands of voters who seemed to reject not so much her policies but
   Clinton herself — making her rebound all the more complicated unless
   the state proves to be an outlier.

   That verdict comes through clearly in the exit poll of New Hampshire’s
   Democratic primary voters. Just over a third of them cited honesty and
   trustworthiness as the most important attribute for the next president,
   and Clinton’s opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, won those voters 91% to
   5%. Asked if one candidate or both shared their values, a third said
   only Sanders did, and he won those voters 97% to 2%.

   The repudiation was across the board. Sanders won almost all categories
   of voters, including women. Clinton had made them a specific target,
   but Sanders won women's votes by 11 points.

   New Hampshire is almost wholly white, more liberal and less religious
   than most states, which may make the defeat here a blip when the
   election season is concluded. But the sharp divisions evident Tuesday
   suggest trouble ahead for the national front-runner.

   As the campaign moves into more diverse states, one big question will
   be whether African American and Latino voters decide by virtue of race
   and ethnicity or age. If minority voters form a bloc, Clinton’s
   strength in states like South Carolina and Nevada is assured. But if
   young minority voters break away from their elders to back Sanders,
   Clinton’s advantage would be diminished.

Chris Christie drops out of GOP race

   campaign event Monday in Council Bluffs, Iowa. (Jae C. Hong /
   Associated Press)

   New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, whose brand of tough-talking politics
   was overtaken by the Donald Trump phenomenon, dropped out of the race
   Wednesday after lagging a crowded Republican field in the New Hampshire
   primary.

   “I have both won elections that I was supposed to lose and I’ve lost
   elections I was supposed to win,” Christie wrote Wednesday, in a
   message on his campaign’s Facebook page.

   “It is both the magic and the mystery of politics that you never quite
   know when which is going to happen, even when you think you do.

   “And so today, I leave the race without an ounce of regret.”

   Christie never expected to do well in the Iowa caucuses, but the
   second-term governor had staked his White House ambitions on a strong
   showing in New Hampshire, spending more than 70 days on the trail
   there. Instead, he finished a disappointing sixth and last night
   announced he would scrap a scheduled trip to South Carolina and return
   to New Jersey to reassess.

   Christie’s hopes in New Hampshire were buoyed after a strong
   performance in Saturday’s debate, in which he mocked and mauled Florida
   Sen. Marco Rubio for repeating a scripted attack line against President
   Obama.

   “There it is,” Christie said, pouncing when Rubio kept repeating the
   stock line. “There it is, the memorized 25-second speech.” Since then,
   Democrats have sent people in robot suits to Rubio events.

   But while the attack appears to have severely damaged Rubio, who
   finished fifth, it failed to boost Christie.

   Four years ago, Christie was seen as a rising star in the Republican
   party and was courted by donors and strategists who thought he would be
   a strong challenger to Obama. But his brand took a hit after the
   bizarre Bridgegate scandal in September 2013, when aides to the
   governor ordered the closure of an access lane to the George Washington
   Bridge, in an episode of apparent political retaliation against a
   Democratic mayor who wouldn’t endorse him.

   Christie also had trouble with many conservatives who loathed Obama and
   could never forgive the governor for his friendly greeting of the
   president after Hurricane Sandy — a few days before the 2012 election.

   By the time he entered the race, Christie was overshadowed by the
   fundraising juggernaut of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, and then by
   Trump, who managed to out-do Christie’s own brand of frank pugnacity.

   “The reality is that Trump out-Christied Christie, with his bombastic
   speech and his tell-it-like-it-is behavior,” said Brigid Callahan
   Harrison, a political science professor at Montclair State University.

   “For voters among whom that had some appeal, there was another
   celebrity candidate to do that.”

   Christie now faces two years left in his term in a state with deep
   financial problems. To make things harder, he no longer can count on
   any political leverage with Democratic legislators. The governor’s
   approval rating in the state is around 33%, half of what it was at his
   peak, Harrison said.

   Christie might have had a decent shot to win the GOP nomination four
   years ago, when he turned down entreaties from prominent Republican
   figures who wanted him to run, Harrison said.

   “He thought that moment could be replicated,” she said. “The reality
   was, that was his moment, and he didn’t have the confidence in himself
   to take that chance.”

Carly Fiorina ends presidential campaign with a message to girls

   After poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, Carly Fiorina announced
   Wednesday that she is ending her presidential bid.

   "I've said throughout this campaign that I will not sit down and be
   quiet. I'm not going to start now," she said in a statement. "While I
   suspend my candidacy today, I will continue to travel this country and
   fight for those Americans who refuse to settle for the way things are
   and a status quo that no longer works for them."

   The White House bid by Fiorina, the former head of Hewlett-Packard, was
   always considered a long shot. She has never held elected office, and
   the only other time she ran — for U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer's California
   seat — she lost by 10 points.

   Still, she gained attention as the only woman in the GOP field, and she
   had fleeting momentum last year after two solid debate performances.
   She spent considerable amounts of time on the ground in the first two
   voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, greeting voters at churches,
   town halls and fairs.

   Ultimately, it failed to pay off. Fiorina received 4.1% of the vote in
   Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, and 1.9% in last week's Iowa caucuses.

   Her statement included a message to young girls and a promise to stay
   visible fighting for conservatism.

   "Do not let others define you," she wrote. "Do not listen to anyone who
   says you have to vote a certain way or for a certain candidate because
   you're a woman. That is not feminism.

   "A feminist is a woman who lives the life she chooses and uses all her
   God-given gifts. And always remember that a leader is not born, but
   made," she wrote.

Clinton, Sanders seeking support from black voters as race heads to South

   (Elise Amendola/AP)

   In her quest to bolster support among black voters, Hillary Clinton has
   touted her close ties to the Obama administration.

   And on Wednesday, with the South Carolina primary in her sights,
   Clinton announced the endorsement of the state's House Minority Leader
   J. Todd Rutherford.

   An early supporter of then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008, Rutherford's
   Columbia, S.C., House district is overwhelmingly black.

   Clinton, who was trounced in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary by Vermont
   Sen. Bernie Sanders,  believes her support among black and Latino
   voters will benefit her as the race heads to South Carolina and Nevada.
   Several polls have shown the former secretary of State has strong
   support among black voters, while many do not know much about Sanders.

   But Sanders has not been dismayed.

   For weeks, his campaign has stressed that his message of income
   inequality and criminal justice reform will resonate with black voters
   once his campaign can engage them.

   On Wednesday, he also received support from prominent black author and
   educator Ta-Nehisi Coates.

   In an interview with Democracy Now, Coates, whose 2014  [30]"The Case
   for Reparations" essay in The Atlantic won a Polk Award, said he would
   vote for the Vermont senator.

   "Had you told me this, like, a year ago, I certainly would not have
   expected, you know, an avowed socialist to be putting up these sorts of
   numbers, and actually be contending for the Democratic Party
   nomination, but I think it’s awesome,” Coates said.  “I think it’s
   great.”

Clinton allies launch $25-million effort targeting minority voters

   Hillary Clinton supporters are launching a $25-million effort aimed at
   turning out black and Latino voters, according to the Associated Press.
   The organization will be advised by Guy Cecil, who runs the
   multi-million dollar pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA. Priorities,
   which collects substantial sums from Wall Street, is a frequent target
   of Bernie Sanders.

   The new group, to be called Every Citizen Counts, will not be focused
   on helping Clinton in the primary. But still, it is another campaign
   committee controlled by friends of Clinton that is positioned to
   collect unlimited sums. It threatens to give Sanders yet another line
   of attack.

   The Clinton super PACs have been treading cautiously so far. The
   attacks they have leveled against Sanders have been limited mostly to
   pitching news organizations unflattering stories about Clinton’s rival
   and media appearances by one of the masterminds behind the groups,
   David Brock, a longtime Clinton loyalist. But they have yet to use the
   tens of millions of dollars they have raised to unleash a major
   advertising effort against the senator, a move that would carry the
   risk of backlash in a race where Sanders has tapped into voter
   resentment over such spending.

Ted Cruz takes on Donald Trump as 'not conservative'

   The Republican presidential primary has not winnowed to a two-candidate
   race after New Hampshire, as Ted Cruz had hoped. So the Texas senator,
   who won the Iowa caucuses, is ramping up for another showdown against
   front-runner Donald Trump.

   "The only way to beat Donald Trump is to highlight his record," Cruz
   said during a campaign swing Wednesday through Myrtle Beach, S.C.,
   before heading back to the Senate for evening votes.

   Cruz attacked the celebrity billionaire as "not conservative" and
   warned South Carolina to look for a candidate who has "walked the
   walk."

   He meant himself.

   "If you want a president who will repeal Obamacare, ask: Who has led
   the fight to repeal Obamacare? If you want a president who will stop
   amnesty and secure the borders, ask: Who has led the fight to stop
   amnesty and secure the borders?"

   Cruz was referring to his efforts that lead to the 2013 government
   shutdown over the Affordable Care Act and his subsequent role in
   temporarily blocking Homeland Security funds to protest President
   Obama's immigration policies.

Basketball, ice cream and Democratic politics

   Bernie Sanders celebrated his win in New Hampshire's presidential
   primary by shooting hoops with the hosts of ABC's daytime talk show
   "The View" and tasting "Bernie's Yearning," the ice cream named after
   the Vermont senator.

   "This the first time I've tasted it," Sanders said. "Excellent. Really
   good."

   Sanders won Tuesday's primary by a wide margin, but the states of
   Nevada and South Carolina, which vote next, should be more favorable to
   Hillary Clinton, his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination.

   “How do you keep this momentum?” Whoopi Goldberg asked Sanders.

   “With a lot of effort, I’ll tell you," he said. "There’s a lot of hard
   work in front of us.”

   Sanders, who [34]met with the Rev. Al Sharpton in Harlem on Wednesday
   morning, said his views on criminal justice and economic inequality
   will connect with black and Latino voters, who have generally leaned
   toward Clinton in public polls.

   For example, he highlighted the high rates of unemployment among black
   youth.

   "Don't tell me we don't need to invest heavily in the African American
   community and create decent-paying jobs," he said.

[36]As 2016 race goes national, challenges expand for N.H. winners Trump and
Sanders

   With a roar of discontent toward the political establishment, New
   Hampshire voters sent the presidential contest into what seems likely
   to be an extended march that will quickly move to territory far less
   hospitable to Tuesday night’s big winners, Bernie Sanders and Donald
   Trump.

   After a riotous eight days that ended with the first successful
   Democratic insurgent win here since 1984 and the first Republican win
   ever by a TV host and real estate entrepreneur, the races now diverge.
   Tuesday marked the end of regional contests and the beginning of a
   national campaign, with all the financial and logistical demands that
   entails.

   On Feb. 20, Democrats in Nevada and Republicans in South Carolina will
   vote. On Feb. 23, Nevada Republicans will make their picks, and four
   days later Democrats will compete in South Carolina. Then the race
   widens to more than a dozen states, many in the South, that vote on
   March 1.

   "And here’s what we’re gonna do," Hillary Clinton said after her loss
   in New Hampshire, speaking for all the candidates Tuesday night. "Now
   we take this campaign to the entire country."

Bernie Sanders hits Harlem

   The first stop Bernie Sanders made after leaving New Hampshire was
   Harlem, where he began his push to boost support among the African
   Americans whose votes are crucial to winning upcoming states in the
   race for the Democratic nomination.

   Sanders had breakfast with the Rev. Al Sharpton at the iconic
   restaurant Sylvia’s.

   “I asked him very bluntly about Flint,” Sharpton said after the
   meeting. “I asked him very bluntly about issues of police brutality and
   police misconduct.” Sharpton said he also asked Sanders to join Hillary
   Clinton in meeting with other civil rights leaders next week, which the
   Vermont senator agreed to do.

   “I have not made an endorsement and will not until after that meeting,”
   Sharpton said. “Probably after that meeting I will.”

   Later, on MSNBC, Sharpton said: “My concern is, as the first black
   family in the White House moves out at the end of the year, our
   concerns don’t move out with them.” Sharpton was pressed on whether
   Sanders, who has had a bumpy relationship with black activists after
   some early run-ins with the Black Lives Matter movement, is going to
   come across as pandering.

   “Both sides are going to be accused of that,” Sharpton said. “You’ve
   got to convince people you mean it, you have the track record and
   you’ve shown the commitment.”

[40]A long road ahead

   Want to know what could happen next in the presidential primary
   contest? You’ll need a map.

   There will be 29 primaries or caucuses held over the next month, along
   with a host of debates, including the Democratic face-off Thursday
   night in Wisconsin. And as Cathleen Decker [41]notes in her analysis
   this morning, the contests will quickly move to territory far less
   hospitable to Tuesday night’s big winners.

   For context, remember that the Republican race in 2012 played out until
   April 10. The Democratic contest between Hillary Clinton and then-Sen.
   Barack Obama eight years ago dragged on through each and every primary
   and caucus, all the way to the end of the calendar. Clinton ended her
   bid on June 7, 2008.

   It’s way too early to know if Californians will be so lucky to hold
   such weight eight years later with our June 7 primary. But Sanders
   promised to keep on from Maine to California.

   And no one on either side dropped out after New Hampshire. [42]Not even
   Jim Gilmore.

Media fixation hurt my N.H. finish, Marco Rubio says

   Stephanie Tespas outside Gilbert Hood Middle School in Derry, N.H.
   (Jacquelyn Martin / Associated Press)

   Marco Rubio said the media's intense focus on his Feb. 6 GOP debate
   performance contributed to his [46]fifth-place finish in New Hampshire.

   On Wednesday, the Florida senator accused the media of fixating on the
   fact that he repeated a talking point several times. Critics said
   Rubio's performance made him look robotic and scripted.

   During the next 72 hours before the New Hampshire primaries, Rubio said
   every question he received challenged his depth of knowledge.

   “That’s absurd,” Rubio argued on [47]NBC’s “Today.” “No one in this
   race, for example, has shown greater depth, knowledge, understanding or
   better judgment on the foreign policy issues than I have.”

   On Tuesday night, Rubio told disappointed supporters that he bore the
   blame.

   “It’s on me,” [48]Rubio told the crowd at a downtown Manchester hotel.
   “I did not do well on Saturday night. That will never happen again.”

   On Wednesday, Rubio predicted that as the GOP race tightens going into
   South Carolina, candidates will have to start explaining their policy
   plans in full.

   Businessman Donald Trump skirts over issues and panders to voters by
   focusing on their frustrations about lingering weaknesses in the
   economy, but he doesn’t detail how he would fix problems, Rubio said.

   “To be president, you can’t go around telling people what’s wrong.  You
   have to tell people how you’re going to fix it,” Rubio said.

   Rubio asserted that he has proposed in-depth plans to deal with tax,
   energy and regulatory reform. He added that he plans to retool his
   campaign to focus on fundamentals in order to prove he brings
   experience to the race.

   “It’s not just about winning the election; it’s about what’s at stake
   here,” Rubio said. “There’s going to be a real focus on policy, and
   we’ll see how people hold up.

   “I’m going to be the nominee,” he predicted.

Donald Trump credits his success to immigration, national security plans

   He came, he fought, he conquered — and Donald Trump took his bow
   Wednesday morning after [49]his win at the Republican New Hampshire
   primaries.

   “It’s a movement. People want to see a smart country. They want to see
   us take the country back,” Trump said on NBC. “We don’t win anymore.”

   The GOP front-runner credited his success to his campaigning on
   immigration, jobs, national security and border control. He called
   himself the candidate who represents what Americans want — minus the
   politics.

   “I am going to be the greatest jobs president that God ever created,”
   he said on CNN’s “New Day.”

   When Trump laid out his plan to build a wall separating the United
   States from Mexico, he said people frustrated with illegal immigration
   saw the hard-line approach as an example of how a businessman would
   perform as president.

   That experience would also parlay into combating a threat like Islamic
   State, he said.

   Trump also justified his repetition of a vulgar word shouted by a
   supporter in New Hampshire as just “having fun” in the moment. He said
   he doesn’t consider himself a politician like other candidates, but
   will refrain from such language in the future.

   “Political correctness is killing us in this country,” Trump [50]said
   on “Today.”

Jeb Bush: Trump provokes, disparages, divides

   After his fourth-place finish in the New Hampshire primary, Jeb
   Bush asserted Wednesday that his campaign’s focus on offering realistic
   policy plans will beat out the fearmongering of businessman Donald
   Trump.

   The former Florida governor, who is fighting to make his way back into
   the main pool of GOP contenders, acknowledged Trump’s 35% share of
   votes in [51]Tuesday's primary. But he said that also shows that about
   two-thirds of remaining voters don’t support him.

   “He provokes people, he disparages people, he divides people,” Bush
   said of Trump on CNN’s “New Day.”

   “Trump’s a master of capturing people’s angst,” he added.

   If elected president, Bush said he would shift power back to the states
   and repeal President Obama's healthcare law. He also announced that his
   brother, former President George W. Bush, will help push his agenda on
   the trail in South Carolina.

   As for John Kasich’s [52]second-place win, Bush told Fox News that the
   people of South Carolina won’t support the Ohio governor.

   “He has nothing going on down there,” Bush said on  “Fox and Friends.”

   Bush also denied reports that his campaign will launch an attack
   against Kasich and Rubio in the coming weeks.

Here's how John Kasich plans to win the GOP nomination

   in Bow, N.H. (Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images)

   If John Kasich wins the Republican presidential nomination, it will be
   through a strategy of attrition, focused on his strength at home in
   Ohio and elsewhere in the Midwest.

   Buoyed by his second-place finish in the New Hampshire primary, Ohio’s
   governor arrived before dawn Wednesday in South Carolina, which holds
   the next GOP contest Feb. 20.

   He appeared on NBC’s “Today” show, where he vowed — notwithstanding his
   pledge to run a positive campaign — to fight back if attacked.

   "I'm not gonna sit there and be a marshmallow and have somebody pound
   me,” Kasich said. “We're not just gonna sit back and take a pounding
   from anybody. But at the same time we're going to tell people what
   we're for, and I think people really, really like it."

   A senior campaign strategist, meantime, described Kasich's hoped-for
   path forward, which amounts to a last-man-standing strategy as others
   fall away, starting with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Florida
   Gov. Jeb Bush in the South Carolina contest.

   The strategist spoke on condition he not be identified discussing the
   campaign's envisioned road map.

   Kasich doesn’t hope to win South Carolina, the strategist said, but
   simply finish strongly enough to survive if Rubio or Bush -- or both --
   drop out.

   On March 1, when more than a dozen states vote, the Kasich strategy is
   to win a handful of states and stay in the mix, with Massachusetts,
   Vermont, Tennessee and Virginia seen among his prime targets.

   Michigan on March 8 is seen as vital a must-win state, that will see
   the same sort of intense focus that Kasich applied to New Hampshire.

   From there, Kasich hopes to roll up wins at home in Ohio, and in
   Illinois and Missouri, which would catapult him forward into the
   remaining contests and help build an irreversible lead in the delegate
   count.

   The one unknown, as it has been throughout this most unconventional
   campaign, is how Donald Trump, the overwhelming winner in New
   Hampshire, performs from here.

   “I’m not going to try to predict what happens to him,” said the Kasich
   strategist. “But as the race narrows, others will rise, and he’s not
   going to get the support of the votes of people backing others who drop
   out.”

   Before the New Hampshire primary, analysts predicted that Donald Trump
   would finish first on the Republican side and that Sen. Bernie Sanders
   would easily defeat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on the
   Democratic ballot. So it transpired, but there were also some
   heartening surprises in Tuesday’s results.

   First the bad news: Donald Trump’s victory in New Hampshire, after his
   second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses, is an ominous development.
   The Republicans and “undeclared” independents who voted for Trump have
   entrusted their hopes to a demagogue with no experience in government
   who demonizes minorities, demeans women and promises to reinstitute
   waterboarding of suspected terrorists and “a hell of a lot worse.” That
   the voters were driven to support him by frustration with the
   unfulfilled promises of professional politicians is an explanation for
   their behavior, but not an excuse.

Acting Tulsa sheriff proposes idea to make money from inmate cell phone calls

   TULSA, Okla. —

   Quick Facts:


     * We the People Oklahoma are upset with a proposed plan from acting
       Tulsa County Sheriff Michelle Robinetter
     * A new FCC regulation lowered rate caps on inmate cell phones
     * Robinette proposed selling cell phone use to inmates through the
       commissary to make up for lost revenue
     * Marq Lewis of We the People called this a way to get around the FCC
       regulation

   A Green Country group is upset with the acting sheriff of Tulsa County
   for proposing an idea they believe it meant to get around federal
   regulations.

   The FCC recently lowered rate caps on inmate cell phone calls. This
   week, acting sheriff Michelle Robinette told the Tulsa Jail Authority
   she was looking into an idea to make up for the lost revenue.

   The FCC decided jails were charging too much money for inmates to call
   family members and attorneys.

   The high costs were affecting families of the inmates and they bear the
   responsibility of putting money into their account.

   Robinette said she’d like to buy cell phones to charge the inmates to
   use. The FCC regulation doesn’t address how inmates are charged for
   this.

   “You’re purchasing it through the commissary so it’s a roundabout, back
   door way to get around the FCC rules,” said attorney Lori Phillips.

   Marq Lewis with We the People Oklahoma said he doesn’t think taking
   more money from the families of inmates is how the jail should try to
   make more money.

   “I think the focus is not on the inmates, how to help them or how to
   reduce incarceration. The focus is, ‘we need more money,’” Lewis said.

   The Jail Authority said the plan is something they would have to
   approve before it could go into effect. The Sheriff’s Office did not
   immediately comment on the plan.

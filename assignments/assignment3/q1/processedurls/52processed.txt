   By [177]Jennifer Harper - The Washington Times - Wednesday, February
   10, 2016

   Amid continued political turmoil, there is an oasis of calm and
   confidence on Capitol Hill, this led by a group of conservatives intent
   on transparency and purpose problem-solving. They keep calm and carry
   on. A monthly event titled “Conversations with Conservatives” showcases
   free market and liberty-minded lawmakers who bristle with conservative
   credentials and doggedly parse out the important issues of the day
   before the press. Reps. Raul R. Labrador, Tim Huelskamp and Jim Jordan
   are the point men here; the group gathering on Thursday at high noon
   includes Reps. Justin Amash, Dave Brat, Jeff Duncan, Louie Gohmert,
   Marsha Blackburn, Mick Mulvaney and Scott Perry.

   “When we started Conversations with Conservatives five years ago, our
   goal was to give the media a regular opportunity to hear directly from
   the House’s most conservative members,” Mr. Labrador tells Inside the
   Beltway. “I think it’s been a success, as we draw a good crowd of
   reporters who get to ask direct questions — and we give them straight
   answers. It helps House conservatives communicate conservative ideas
   about solving the many pressing problems facing our great country.”

   The event is moderated by Genevieve Wood, a senior fellow at The
   Heritage Foundation.

   FAITH NOW FUELS THE 2016 CAMPAIGN

   The power of evangelical voters comes to the forefront of the
   presidential race when the attention of candidates, press and public
   shifts to South Carolina, and with it a distinct focus on faith and
   values. Sen. Ted Cruz and Ben Carson are particularly at home here. On
   Thursday, both head for the Carolina Values Summit at Winthrop
   University in Rock Hill. Then, for Mr. Cruz, it’s on to a rally with
   independent media maven Glenn Beck at the MorningStar Fellowship Church
   in Fort Mill.

   Mr. Beck, who recently endorsed Mr. Cruz, has been campaigning for him
   in the Palmetto State since Sunday, cautioning voters not to be taken
   in by the “revolutions” of Republican front-runner Donald Trump and his
   Democratic archrival, Sen. Bernard Sanders. The former represents
   “crony capitalism,” Mr. Beck warns, the latter socialism.

   “There is a path to winning. It is time to coalesce behind the
   Constitution, and it’s time to say, ‘I pick that revolution.’ Because
   the other two, Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, those two revolutions
   spell the end of the republic. Will you go down with your eyes shut or
   your eyes wide open? Or will you hang on to the only principle that
   will save us, and that is the Constitution?” Mr. Beck asked his TV
   audience on Wednesday.

   Things intensify Friday with the Faith and Family Forum at Bob Jones
   University; both Messrs. Cruz and Carson are scheduled to speak, along
   with Jeb Bush — to be followed by the ninth — yes, the ninth —
   Republican Debate on Saturday in Greenville, South Carolina, this one
   hosted by CBS.

   MR. OBAMA’S VERY BUSY DAY

   “In the morning, the President will participate in a DSCC roundtable at
   a private residence. In the afternoon, the President will deliver
   remarks at a DNC event at a private residence. Later in the afternoon,
   the President will depart San Jose, California en route Los Angeles.
   Afterward, the President will tape an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres
   Show. In the evening, the President will deliver remarks at a DNC event
   at a private residence. Later in the evening, the President will
   deliver remarks and take questions at a DNC event at a private
   residence.”

   — From a White House dispatch issued Wednesday night; the schedule
   includes four Democratic fundraisers

   SAW IT COMING

   Following Gov. Chris Christie’s withdrawal as a Republican presidential
   candidate, one close observer has issued a warning of sorts.

   “Christie signed his own death warrant with conservatives when he
   nominated liberal activist judges to the New Jersey Supreme Court,”
   says Carrie Severino, chief counsel to the Judicial Crisis network. “He
   executed his death warrant when he lied repeatedly about supporting
   Sonia Sotomayor’s nomination to the Supreme Court. The next president
   will appoint as many as three justices. This is not the year for
   conservative politicians to abandon their commitment to the
   Constitution or to nominating judges who faithfully interpret it.”

   After a tough legal battle, followed by political stalemate, Anaheim
   finalized its new voting districts for city council members Tuesday
   night and will start using them in November.

   For the first time, Anaheim residents will elect city council members
   by districts instead of at-large or citywide. And the new council will
   be a larger one, consisting of six members instead of four. ​

   The move comes after years of complaints about unequal representation
   of Latinos and other minority ethnic groups in local politics.

   “We’re changing the way we elect the people,” said Mayor Tom Tait on
   Tuesday. “We’re changing the way we are to be governed. This brings
   government much closer to the people and City Hall much more
   accountable to the people.”

   District elections have been a long time coming for Anaheim. The fight
   started in 2012 when [30]a group of Latino voters sued the city
   claiming the at-large voting system was unfair to minority residents
   and prevented them from having equal representation on city council.

   Through a settlement agreement, the city asked voters to weigh in.
   Anaheim residents passed the district elections measure in 2014 with 68
   percent of the vote.

   A committee of retired judges held a series of public meetings last
   year to come up with a voting map. [31]After more meetings and some
   drama, the city council settled on the committee recommended map dubbed
   by the community as “The People’s Map.”

   The map outlines the six new districts--four of which will go up for
   election in November. The mayor will continue to be elected at-large.

   “Anaheim is ready to move on and I’m sure you are, too,” South Anaheim
   resident and union organizer Martin Lopez told the council on Tuesday.

   With that in mind, here are some immediate changes you can expect now
   that Anaheim has a new districts voting map in place:

   1. The county’s registrar will update his voter rolls.

   Anaheim voters used to cast ballots for every council seat that was up
   for election no matter where in the city you lived. Now, with district
   elections, only residents that live in those districts up for election
   can cast ballots for their candidates of choice. (Reminder: the mayor
   will still be elected at-large.)

   In November, districts 1, 3, 4, and 5 will be up for election.

   Orange County Registrar of Voters Neal Kelley said his office would be
   obtaining data from the city of Anaheim to integrate into its precinct
   system to determine which voters are in which districts and who will
   need a ballot.

   “It’s pretty seamless,” he said.

   2. Expect a voter education blitz.

   If you haven’t already determined what district you live in, [32]check
   out the map and soon enough the voter registration rolls will be
   updated. But spokesperson for the City of Anaheim Mike Lyster said the
   City Clerk's office will soon launch a public awareness campaign.

   He said residents will see the new voting map at public libraries and
   community centers indicating which district you're currently in. Look
   for write-ups in the city's [33]Anaheim Magazine, which has a Spanish
   edition.

   "The City Clerk’s office also will be on hand at community events with
   our Anaheim Votes pop-up display with information about districts and
   the election," Lyster said.

   3. Expect voter registration events.

   It’s simple: electing a candidate of choice requires voting. And to
   vote, you must be registered.

   [34]Districts 3, 4 and 5 in Anaheim are heavy Latino districts but only
   District 3 is a considered to be a Latino voter majority district.
   District 4 and 5 are pluralities so it'll take a full force of showing
   at the polls plus some collaboration with other community groups for
   Latinos, as a group, to elect candidates of their choice.

   You can expect community groups, Orange County political parties and
   candidates to hold voter registration events to sign up Anaheim
   residents eligible to cast ballots.

   4. More candidates, more campaign signs.

   Not only will you have two additional council seats up for elections
   than in the past, but also district elections, in theory, attract more
   would-be candidates from the voting population.

   Note: July 6 is the deadline for candidates to register with the Orange
   County Registrar of Voters.

   Expect more campaign signs in yards and taped to fences this summer –
   that’s if candidates and campaign committees have the money to spend on
   marketing.

   But again, in theory, district elections are supposed to do a better
   job than at-large elections of keeping big money out of campaigns
   simply based on the idea those residents, businesses and stakeholders
   that live in a particular district will care about their candidates and
   not others running in other districts … in theory.

   5. Maybe a new map in the Anaheim City Hall lobby

   If you’ve ever been to Anaheim City Hall, you’ve seen that big map of
   the city hanging above the information desk near the entrance. No
   guarantees or confirmation but maybe the city will swap it out for the
   new district voting map that shows the six districts and their
   boundaries.

   And with that in mind, Anaheim council members can expect less
   elbowroom on the dais – quite literally. Although there are already two
   empty chairs on each end of the council chambers, elected officials
   will have to get used to seeing two more bodies sitting in those
   chairs.

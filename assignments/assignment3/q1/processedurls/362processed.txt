♡ UNISON: ‘come together’ urges Wendy Nichols

   UNISON president issues call as activists and members get out and about
   to spread pride in the union
   Wnedy_MR_2009

   “The Trade Union Bill has no place in a modern democracy,” UNISON
   president Wendy Nichols says as the ♡ unions / ♡ UNISON week from 8
   to 14 February gets under way to celebrate the work of unions and their
   workplace reps.

   “Only through coming together and showing our united strength will we
   be able defeat this bill.”

   The week of action comes in the face of the government’s Trade Union
   Bill, which seeks to restrict people’s right to representation at work.

   Ms Nichols is also secretary of the union’s North Yorkshire branch,
   uniting 6,000 members working for various employers, who will be out
   and about telling the public how important unions are.

   They will be out leafleting at train stations in Selby, Northallerton
   and Harrogate as part of the week of action to make current members
   feel proud, spread the word and highlight the benefits of being in a
   trade union.

   North Yorkshire UNISON represents members working for North Yorkshire
   County Council, Hambleton District Council, Richmondshire District
   Council, Selby District Council, Selby Town Council, the National Parks
   and in the voluntary and independent sectors.

   Share the love this ♡ Unions Week and [66]tell us why you ♡ UNISON.

[84]Let us work for a better future: drop the Trade Union Bill

   The Trade Union Bill currently before Parliament is unfair, unnecessary
   and undemocratic. MPs need to focus on the real problems the country
   faces and talk to us about how we can work together for a better
   future.

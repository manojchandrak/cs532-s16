   A stack of books prepared by Liberation Library is ready for shipment
   to three Illinois youth detention centers.

Liberation Library empowers youth in prison with books of their own (video)

   [32]February 9, 2016 [33]xiaolyu

   By Xiao Lyu

   In a temporary place on the Near West Side, a small group of volunteers
   made bookmarks and wrote notes for a pack of books ready to be shipped
   to three juvenile detention centers in Illinois.

   Having struggled for a while about what to write, first-time volunteer
   Paul Dailing chose some simple personal notes, such as “Hey, the art
   looks really fantastic” and “Hope you’ll enjoy it”.

   “It’s just something valuable and should be done,” Dailing said.
   It was a typical book packing day, an event that happens twice a month
   in [34]Liberation Library, a community organization in Chicago that
   provides books to incarcerated youths in Illinois Department of
   Juvenile Justice facilities in Kewanee, Pere Marquette, and Harrisburg.
   Since their first shipment of 84 books in July, 2015, more than 300
   books have been shipped.

   Liberation Library was founded by Mariame Kaba, who is also the founder
   of Project NIA, a grassroots organization aiming to end youth
   incarceration.

   As of June 30, 2015, the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice (IDJJ)
   housed, on average, 725 youth each day. According to the department’s
   2015 annual report, the youth typically spend seven-and-a-half months
   in the facility; there are six of them in Illinois.

Hard to find teachers

   In 2012, a class action lawsuit was filed by the American Civil
   Liberties Union (ACLU) against the IDJJ, seeking improvements in
   education, mental health services, and general health and safety
   conditions. The 2015 annual report states that the IDJJ has not yet met
   educational requirements for full-time, full-day schooling at Kewanee
   and St. Charles, due to the challenge in hiring teachers.

   According to department spokesman Michael Theodore, the current
   student/ teacher ratio for education programs at the facilities is
   10:1.

   Seeing the dire need to improve education for youth in prison, Kaba
   founded Liberation Library in February 2015.

   “It’s important for young people to have access to books in general,
   most especially if they are caged behind bars,” Kaba said in a phone
   interview. “Books make a difference in our lives.”

   Youth participants can select books of their choosing based on
   Liberation Library’s inventory, which covers a wide range of genres
   with a special focus on youth issues and problems young people face
   growing up.

   Books with a high demand include fiction, such as “Tyrell” by Coe Booth
   and the thriller “Kiss the Girls (Alex Cross)” by James Patterson.

   “These books are a form of communication onto itself,” said Jocelyn
   Nelson, one of the 10 steering committee members now in charge of
   running the organization. “So it was really powerful to hear just how
   important the books they were able to pick for themselves were to
   them.”

Plans for expansion

   Recalling a recent visit to the facility in Harrisburg to consult with
   the youth and expand their booklist, Nelson said she saw the impact of
   Liberation Library’s work.

   “All the youth that we spoke to or walked by the halls, they knew our
   name, they knew our work,” Nelson said. “So we are realizing that we
   are really having an impact on these youth.”

   Liberation Library has raised more than $4,400 on its online fundraiser
   page. The funds were used for book purchasing, packing and shipment.

   The fledgling group is currently working to expand the book shipment to
   other youth detention centers in Illinois, and seeking partnership for
   new possibilities and initiatives, including a pen pal program with
   Chicago Public Schools students.

   “We are at very early stages, so we want to be really intentional about
   how we are going to expand,” Nelson said. “We would like to talk more
   about the politics and history behind why we are doing this work, and
   we want to share that both with community members and classrooms.”

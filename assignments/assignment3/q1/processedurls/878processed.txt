     Returning to the city where he announced his run for the presidency
     nine years ago, President Barack Obama Wednesday called for a more
     cooperative politics before an Illinois state government that’s been
     bitterly divided for months.

     In a roughly [44]one-hour speech before a joint session of the
     Illinois General Assembly, Obama said that citizenship is
     “threatened by a poisonous political climate that pushes people away
     from participating in our public life.”

     “It turns folks off. It discourages them. It makes them cynical,”
     Obama said. “And when that happens, more powerful and extreme voices
     fill the void.”

     Obama recalled his early political career when he served in the
     state Senate from 1997 until 2004 before being elected to the U.S.
     Senate. Mingling with lawmakers from both parties at fish fries and
     over poker games, Obama said he learned the lessons of both parties
     working together to pass legislation.

     “We wouldn’t bend on our most deeply held principles, but we were
     willing to forge compromise in pursuit of a larger goal,” Obama
     said. “We were practical when we needed to be. This is why I’ve
     always believed so deeply in a better kind of politics.”

     Obama also said that bipartisan cooperation isn’t a bad thing.

     “In a big, complicated democracy like ours, if we can’t compromise,
     by definition we can’t govern ourselves,” Obama said. “Trying to
     find common ground doesn’t make me less of a Democrat or less of a
     progressive, it means I’m trying to get stuff done. The same applies
     to Republicans. When I hear voices in either party boast of their
     refusal to compromise as an accomplishment in and of itself, I’m not
     impressed.”

     The president called it a “myth” that the political environment
     today is unique or hopeless and that politicians today aren’t more
     beholden than they have been in the past.

     “We’ve gone through periods when we thought democracy was stuck,”
     Obama said. “We have to find a new way to do business. We’re in one
     of those moments.”

     No 'clean hands'

     The president, who has 11 months left in office, outlined four
     solutions he said would help accomplish his goal of a better
     politics. They include reducing “some of the corrosive influence of
     money in our politics.”

     “I don’t believe that money is speech or that political spending
     should have no limits or shouldn’t be disclosed,” Obama said.

     Page 2 of 3 - He also called for changes in the way congressional
     districts are drawn after the decennial census. He said both parties
     are guilty of gerrymandering districts to achieve a political
     advantage.

     “Nobody has clean hands on this thing,” Obama said. “In America,
     politicians should not pick their voters, voters should pick their
     politicians.”

     Obama’s comments specifically mentioned congressional districts, not
     political maps that determine state legislatures. Gov. Bruce Rauner
     wants changes to legislative redistricting as part of his turnaround
     agenda.

     Obama also said steps should be taken to increase voter
     participation. Along with same-day registration and early voting, he
     specifically mentioned a bill sponsored by Sen. Andy Manar, D-Bunker
     Hill, to automatically register voters when they apply for driver's
     licenses.

     “As one of your constituents, I think you should pass that
     legislation right away,” he said.

     Finally, he said those in the political area should exhibit more
     civility.

     “We can’t move forward if all we do is tear each other down,” Obama
     said.

     'Hit some nerves'

     Springfield-area lawmakers said they were unsure if Obama’s speech
     would help Illinois break its political impasse over the budget and
     Rauner’s agenda.

     “I think he was addressing both sides in equal parts,” Manar said.
     “I do think it offers us a new perspective that I hope will be
     helpful moving forward. I count it as a perspective coming from the
     president of the United States that I hope will be helpful to break
     the impasse that has brought our state to a halt.”

     “I think there were a lot of things Republicans and Democrats can
     agree to,” said Rep. C.D. Davidsmeyer, R-Jacksonville.
     “Unfortunately I think politics are playing too big a role in
     Springfield for (that speech) to have an effect.”

     Rep. Sara Wojcicki Jimenez, R-Leland Grove, said lawmakers will have
     to wait and see if there is any lasting impact.

     “I think we should observe to see if it makes any difference,” she
     said. “I’ve been hopeful that we can work together and work toward
     compromise very quickly. The point is we should all be listening to
     all people’s points of view.”

     Rep. Avery Bourne, R-Raymond, said that while she disagrees with the
     president on a number of issues, she hopes state leaders follow
     Obama’s calls for compromise and working together, which she thinks
     could affect the budget impasse.

     Sen. John Sullivan, D-Rushville, said Obama’s message “maybe hit
     some nerves on both sides of the aisle. I think we were very
     sensitive to some of the comments he made and some of the issues he
     talked about. I think the president was actually a little startled
     by some of the reaction that the members both sides of the aisle
     gave to some of the issues.”

     Page 3 of 3 - Sen. Sam McCann, R-Plainview, said he particularly
     took note of Obama’s comments about politics should be less
     spectacle and more about ideas, that “unlimited dark money drowns
     out the voices of the people,” and that the country remains a work
     in progress.

     “The politics of today almost rewards divisors, not uniters,” McCann
     said.

     Springfield Mayor Jim Langfelder was among those to greet Obama
     after Air Force One landed at Abraham Lincoln Capital Airport
     Wednesday, and he watched the president’s speech at the Capitol from
     the gallery.

     “I see it at all levels of government – it’s very important to
     compromise for the common good,” Langfelder said. “That’s what it
     all comes down to.”

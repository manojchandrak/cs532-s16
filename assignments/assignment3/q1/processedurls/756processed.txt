   Shop vacancy falls to lowest level since 2009 A drop in vacancy rates
   could be promising news for the high street

   Britain’s shop vacancy in January decreased to its lowest mark in six
   years to 12.5 per cent, a study shows.

   The shopping centre vacancy rate dropped by 0.4 per cent in January
   2016 when compared to the previous month, according to a study by the
   Local Data Company.

   Wales (-1.0 per cent) and Greater London (-0.8 per cent) saw the
   biggest drops in vacancy rate across the UK nations and regions.

   Compared to January 2015, Wales has seen the highest increase in
   vacancy rate over the 12-month period. Wales’ shopping centre vacancy
   rate increased by 2.2 per cent in the 12 months to January 2016.

   The region with the best-performing retail parks is Yorkshire and the
   Humber, which saw a 0.9 per cent drop in January when compared to
   December.

   Persistent vacancy calculates the number of units vacant for longer
   than three years. A unit that has remained vacant for over the three
   years is unlikely to be reoccupied.

   The North East is the only region to see a change in its persistent
   vacancy rate in the last month, with a 0.1 per cent drop when compared
   to December 2015.

   The region with the highest percentage of persistently vacant units is
   the North East. The North of England, Scotland and Wales, all have
   persistent vacancy rates above the GB average (4.5 per cent).

   The number of long-term (vacant for 3+ years) shops increased from
   9,796 at the end of 2014 to 12,350 in January 2016 (+26 per cent).

   Matthew Hopkinson, director at LDC says that the numbers are
   encouraging due to January having seen a net increase in the occupation
   of shops, rather than the removal of empty shops from the overall
   stock.

   'The GB national vacancy rate is also now at a level not seen since
   December 2009. What is also encouraging is that high vacancy towns such
   as Newport, Doncaster, Bradford and Blackburn have seen improvements.
   Conversely small centres near Liverpool including Old Swan, Everton,
   Gateacre and Hoole have seen vacancy rates increase,' he adds.

   The fact that interest rates do not look like they will increase in
   2016, oil prices are set to remain low for the very long term and that
   employment and incomes are rising albeit slowly means good news for
   retailers as consumers will continue to spend, be it online, in-store
   or both, Hopkinson notes.

   He also points out an area of concern as being the number of units that
   have been vacant for more than three years increasing by 26 per cent in
   the last year to over 12,000 which equates to 'six Manchesters lying
   empty'.

   'Nearly 5 per cent of Britain’s town and city centre shops have
   remained empty for more than three years.

   'So while we have seen some positive signs at the start of 2016 for the
   ‘high street’, we cannot shy away from the vast numbers of empty shops
   that are never likely to be reoccupied again.'

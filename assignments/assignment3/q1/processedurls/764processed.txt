Ulema Council to ban Muslims
from LGBT advocacy

   Following the recent controversy over LGBT groups on university
   campuses, an ulema group has paved the way for banning all activities
   that advocate freedom of sexual orientation.
   The Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) has confirmed that it is currently
   preparing a fatwa, or a non-legally binding edict, that will recommend
   the prosecution of Muslims who join in LGBT-related activities.
   MUI chairman Ma’ruf Amin told The Jakarta Post the
   government-sanctioned body was preparing the fatwa and was soon to
   announce it.
   Ma’ruf said that as the MUI had earlier issued a fatwa declaring LGBT
   communities “religiously, culturally and morally deviant”, through this
   fatwa it was looking to ban Muslims from joining any groups promoting
   LGBT rights in Indonesia, a country with a majority Muslim population.
   “We want Muslims to be cautious of LGBT [activities]. This is not about
   LGBT people, but more to do with their movements. There is a lot that
   is deviant about it,” Ma’ruf said recently, adding that the fatwa was
   an effective way of reminding Muslims about the “danger” of LGBT
   movements, which he noted had increased in recent years in Indonesia.
   Ma’ruf said that the fatwa would also seek a ban on LGBT groups in
   Indonesia.
   LGBT activities on campus came into the spotlight recently when
   conservative media coverage attacked the Support Group and Resource
   Center on Sexuality Studies (SGRC) at the University of Indonesia (UI),
   triggering hostile remarks from public officials including Research,
   Technology and Higher Education Minister Muhammad Nasir and Education
   and Culture Minister Anies Baswedan.
   The hostility was exacerbated by a tough stance against LGBT rights
   from the country’s largest Islamic organization, Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) —
   known for its moderate stance on minority issues — as well as from the
   traditionally inclusive National Awakening Party (PKB).
   MUI edict commission secretary Asrorun Niam said that LGBT activity was
   a deviant way to channel sexual desire and if spread widely in society
   it could disrupt “legal and social” order.
   He said that the MUI was also looking to recommend that the government
   include articles that provided legal basis for charging people who
   enjoyed such “deviant sexual activity”, adding that human rights in
   Indonesia should comply with religious and moral values.
   Asrorun called on Muslims across the country not to discriminate
   against LGBT people, whom he said “should be rehabilitated to cure
   their homosexuality”.
   “For those who campaign for [LGBT rights], there should be firm legal
   prosecution to protect the legal and social order of society,” he said.
   Setara Institute deputy chairman Bonar Tigor Naipospos called on the
   government to reject the MUI’s call to ban LGBT groups in Indonesia,
   saying a fatwa could not be used a basis to make a law or regulation.
   “In the process of making a law, lawmakers should not only consider the
   views of religious groups but also [...] members of the public.
   Indonesia has strong influences from religious groups, thus, it is
   difficult to expect the state to legitimize LGBT [expression], but it
   does not mean that the government should not give LGBT people the same
   treatment as other citizens,” Bonar said.
   Amid the controversy, organizers have postponed a Valentine’s Day “G
   Nite Party” in Surabaya, East Java, citing lack of a security guarantee
   or protection from law enforcement agencies.
   “We eventually postponed the event, scheduled for Feb. 7 at one of the
   karaoke parlors in the Maj. Gen Sungkono area, after police were unable
   to provide security to revelers,” GAYa Nusantara board member Dede
   Oetomo told the Post on Sunday.
   Dede said that after the police questioned them on their event
   licensing, the organizing committee immediately consulted with the
   Surabaya City Police.
   “The police did not ban the event, but they could not guarantee [our
   security] if we were attacked by religious groups. In the event of an
   attack, police could also not blame the [attackers] because the
   lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual (LGBT) community has not been
   recognized in Indonesia,” said Dede.
   Surabaya Police spokesman Comr. Lily Djafar said police would call off
   the G Night Party event on the grounds it did not have a police permit.
   “Any activities involving a crowd must have permission from the police
   — without one they are regarded as illegal. If the event were to be
   held, we would take action in accordance with applicable laws,” said
   Lily.
   She added that if the organizers applied for a permit, police could not
   immediately issue it because in general, police only issued permit for
   events that did not disturb public order.

   Taking a Broad View of Synapses
   02/11/2016
   Rina Shaikh-Lesko
   Researchers have updated a decades-old EM labeling technique to get a
   new perspective on synapses over a large area of the cortex. Learn

   For years, neuroscientists have used electron microscopy (EM) to study
   brain regions and changes in synapses. The process is labor-intensive,
   so it usually means studying just a small portion of the brain at a
   time. Now a team of researchers in Alison Barth’s lab at Carnegie
   Mellon University has unveiled a novel method for studying synapses
   that speeds up the process dramatically. They described their approach
   in a paper in the Journal of Neuroscience.

   “Until now, the trend has been to take a tiny region in the brain and
   learn everything about that cube of tissue. But if you don’t know where
   synapses are coming from, you can’t do anything with some of that
   information,” said Barth.

   The researchers dug up an older EM staining technique using ethanolic
   phosphotungstic acid (EPTA), which only highlights synapses. They also
   developed a computer algorithm to search for the synapses in EM images.
   After selectively clipping whiskers of young mice to change how they
   learned about their environment, Barth and colleagues then analyzed
   shifts in synapse density and length during critical developmental
   stages.

   The method allows for a broad view of synaptic changes in regions of
   the brain because it can process a breathtaking number of images
   quickly. Using the technique, the researchers analyzed almost 25,000
   images containing 40,000 synapses.

   “I love the idea that we could collect a ton of data and use that to
   drive our hypotheses,” said Barth. “The extent that we could look at
   coordinated changes means we can develop much better hypotheses.”

   The team found some surprising increases and decreases in synapse
   density in some brain areas, a finding they will explore further with
   other techniques that can capture details at the cellular level. Barth
   also intends to develop a way to selectively label different types of
   synapses since their method is currently unable to distinguish one type
   of synapse from another.

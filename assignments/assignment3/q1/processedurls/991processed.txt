   Proposed campaign finance reform would dramatically curb spending in
   Lehigh County races

   Lehigh County Executive [8]Tom Muller added his proposal Monday to a
   growing collection of local campaign finance reforms following news of
   an FBI probe into Allentown's contracts and political donations.

   Taking a page out of Philadelphia's campaign finance law, Democrat
   Muller said he will lobby the Republican-majority county commissioners
   to cap how much candidates can raise from individual donors and how
   much they can spend on the campaign trail. As of now, the county has
   neither.

   "I believe Philadelphia got it right, and I think it's time the county
   got it right," Muller said in an interview with The Morning Call.

   Under the proposal, candidates would not be able to accept each year
   more than $2,500 from a single person or $7,500 from an individual
   political action committee. Once the money is in hand, the candidate
   would face annual spending limits, ranging from $125,000 for county
   executive candidates to $7,500 for commissioner candidates running for
   specific districts.

   Muller's proposal would have a dramatic impact if approved as is. Four
   Republican candidates running as a slate this November spent $44,232
   between them and their PAC even before the May primary. Under Muller's
   plan, they could spend no more than $50,000 total.

   Muller said he started kicking around the idea after he and former
   Commissioner Scott Ott spent approximately $200,000 each in their 2013
   battle for the executive's office. He abandoned the effort after
   relations soured between himself and the 7-2 Republican
   controlled-board of commissioners, but he revisited it after Republican
   Commissioner Vic Mazziotti proposed crafting legislation that would bar
   campaign donors from seeking business with the county in some
   instances.

   "The bottom line is we ought to stop this nonsense," Muller said of the
   escalating costs of campaigns.

   It's unclear how much support the proposal has among the board of
   commissioners. Democratic Commissioner Geoff Brace said he would
   introduce it so it could be discussed in conjunction with Mazziotti's
   proposal. Brace and Muller both stressed that no one in county
   government has done anything untoward or illegal in their fundraising
   efforts in recent years.

   "Everybody has played by the rules," Brace said. "I don't know if the
   rules are necessarily serving the voters and the public."

   Commissioner Lisa Scheller, one of the largest donors to local
   Republican campaigns in the past few years, didn't see it that way.
   Muller presented charts to the media outlining the donations she and
   her husband, former Lehigh County Republican Chairman Wayne Woodman,
   have made in the past three years, and she said Muller was clearly
   targeting her.

   "I feel that limits on the contributions are a suppression of speech,"
   Scheller said. "I think there's a lot we can do to engage in reform
   here in Lehigh County before we have a conversation about limitations."

   Federal law could be on Scheller's side. While the U.S. Supreme Court
   has supported limiting how much individual donors and PACs can provide
   a candidate, the spending limits could violate the First Amendment
   rights of candidates who want to spend their own money. The
   Philadelphia law gets around this by increasing the amount of money
   other candidates can spend if candidates surpass specific spending
   benchmarks. Muller's one-page outline did not include that language.

   "[Spending limits] are more questionable in terms of the
   constitutionality," said Chris Borick, a political scientist and
   pollster at Muhlenberg College. "The courts have said generally you
   cannot cap someone unless there is some sort of agreement [among
   candidates]."

   Muller acknowledged there could be legal challenges and said he would
   understand if the proposal gets reduced to a resolution, which would
   have no binding authority. Should that happen, he would hope candidates
   could work under an honor system and agree to self-imposed limits in
   campaigns.

   "Both sides of the hallway should make a stand that we want spending
   and fundraising under control," Muller said, referring to the
   fourth-floor offices of the administration and board of commissioners.

   Neither Mazziotti's nor Muller's proposal has been presented in bill
   form. Both said their concepts are being vetted by the law department,
   and issues such as punishment for violating the reforms need to be
   reviewed. Both men said they were also open to negotiating parts of
   their proposals.

   Bethlehem Mayor Robert Donchez has implemented new policies barring
   employees from receiving gifts from people who do business with the
   city. Allentown City Councilwoman Jeannette Eichenwald has endorsed
   legislation in the city identical to Mazziotti's proposal.

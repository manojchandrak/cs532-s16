Cybersmile To Form Part Of A New Twitter Trust And Safety Council

   11th February 2016 [28]Cybersmile Cyberbullying Twitter HQ

Twitter are making an incredible effort to strike the right balance between
addressing genuine online abuse while at the same time, empowering and
facilitating freedom of speech – it’s extraordinarily complex.

   We are delighted to announce that [29]Cybersmile are to make up part of
   a brand new Trust and Safety Council formed by Twitter. With hundreds
   of millions of tweets sent per day by 320 million users, the new
   Twitter Trust & Safety Council will be working hard to strike the
   perfect balance of [30]user safety while protecting Twitter users
   freedom of expression. Cybersmile and selected experts around the world
   will be helping Twitter in the formation of new products, policies and
   programs – offering the platform a diversity of specialist voices.

   As [31]trusted safety partners with Twitter, Cybersmile welcome the
   opportunity to contribute to the growth of Twitter, ensuring [32]those
   users needing extra help and support know [33]where to find it – and
   those abusing freedom of speech, don’t ruin the experience for the
   majority of genuine, positive and creative users. With such a huge
   number of tweets being created each day, Twitter is facing a massive
   task in addressing this issue – a commendable one. By compiling such a
   diverse group to support their efforts, they have certainly made a
   positive step in the right direction.

“Cybersmile have been talking about the need for collective solutions for a
long time, to see major stakeholders such as Intel and now Twitter forming
action and support groups like this, is very encouraging indeed.”

   Dan Raisbeck, Cybersmile Co-Founder

   We are thrilled with Twitter’s continual commitment in addressing
   [34]online abuse and are excited to work closely with everyone
   involved. If you are affected by online abuse please visit our
   [35]Online Abuse and Cyberbullying Help Center or access our [36]Total

A Changing World

   With the world becoming increasingly digital, access to the internet is
   now widely considered to be a necessity rather than a conscious
   decision. Regardless of choice, our lives revolve around technology. We
   believe that everybody should have equal opportunities to embrace this
   technology and develop as an integral part of our new digital world
   without suffering abuse, harassment or intimidation.

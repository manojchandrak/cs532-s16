   Update: Colorado Springs geyser caused by broken valve

   COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -

   Colorado Springs Utilities said late Wednesday that it was a blown fire
   hydrant valve, not a broken water main, that sent water shooting into
   the air near Murray and Pikes Peak earlier in the day.

   The spectacle unfolded on S. Murray Boulevard between Eastcrest Circle
   and Byron Drive.

   "I have never seen this before so I think it's pretty cool but scary,"
   said Lorie Mondragon who shot video of the temporary geyser.

   The utility said a dozen service lines were affected. The affected
   customers were expected to be without water until around 7 p.m.
   Wednesday.

   Traffic is down to one lane in each direction in the area and will
   remain that way until repairs are complete.  Crews hope to be done
   Thursday morning.

   Steve Berry with Colorado Springs Utilities said the valve is almost 50
   years old. He said infrastructure installed during the 1970s is made of
   a metal especially susceptible to erosion.

   "We have about 35 percent of our system that is between 30 and 50 years
   old," said Berry.

   Each year, CSU spends between $6 million to $7 million dollars
   repairing its aging infrastructure. Berry said CSU can't repair as many
   old pipes as it would like because CSU must also keep rates low for
   customers.

   "It's the balance of maintaining reliability of our system and at the
   same time, keeping rates affordable," said Berry.

   Last year, heavy rain overwhelmed infrastructure across the city,
   leading to dozens of sink holes. In Wednesday's case, Berry said snow
   melt did not affect the valve.

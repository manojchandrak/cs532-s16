   A multicopter complex armed with anti-tank missiles has been unveiled
   at a military robot conference near Moscow. Consisting of several
   drones, the complex is set to perform reconnaissance tasks, monitor the
   battlefield and eliminate targets.

   The versatile airborne robotic complex has been developed by
   Sistemprom, an integral part of the United Instrument Manufacturing
   Corporation (Rostec). It was presented at the Russian Armed Forces
   Robotics conference at Kubinka’s Patriot military expo, west of Moscow.

   The system consists of four drones: a robotic helicopter, sentinel
   multicopter, reconnaissance multicopter, and an assault multicopter
   armed with “rocket-powered munitions.” The drones can perform tasks
   separately or as a joint task force.

   “Sistemprom’s hardware is called to replace [soldiers] effectively
   where it is possible, be it scouting, patrolling, monitoring,
   cartography, transportation and combat missions,” Sergey Skokov,
   Rostec’s deputy director general, told RIA Novosti on Wednesday.

   A group of drones could operate in a fully autonomous mode –
   establishing a position and keeping to a designated route, and also
   interacting with other robotic complexes.

   Each component of the complex has specific capabilities.

   The robotic helicopter has an operating range of hundreds of
   kilometers, can perform video surveillance, make meteorological
   observations, and deliver cargo to designated coordinates.

   The reconnaissance multicopter collects video and photo material using
   a thermal imaging device, and passes the data in real-time mode to its
   control station.

   The sentinel multicopter can adjust artillery fire, verifying a
   target’s coordinates, and monitor the situation of the battlefield.

   The assault multicopter is armed with unspecified “rocket-powered
   munitions.”

   All the drones use the combined GLONASS/GPS navigation system for
   positioning, course bearing and target linking.

   Another Rostec company, Vega Concern, has presented a modernized
   hardware and software robotic group control package capable of managing
   up to 10 UAVs and robots on the ground, acting as an integral task
   force.

   The system’s mobile control center is mounted on a vehicle with good
   cross-country ability, is equipped with crew stations for five
   operators, and could function autonomously for up to a week. Setting up
   the mobile control station takes less than 15 minutes.

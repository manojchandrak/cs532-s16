Rare gyrfalcon stares into camera in Churchill, Man.

The camera captures the northern lights at night, the falcon during the day

   [64]CBC News Posted: Feb 10, 2016 3:40 PM CT Last Updated: Feb 10, 2016

   RAW: Rare white falcon caught on camera (courtesy: explore.org) 0:20

   A bird that is rarely spotted is being seen by thousands in a video
   taken in Churchill, Man. and posted to Facebook.

   Heidi den Haan, assistant director of the Churchill Northern Studies
   Centre, said the bird is a white gyrfalcon, which is "unique."

   "They're not that common to begin with but they hang out here in the
   wintertime," she said.

   On Tuesday, explore.org, a multimedia organization that documents
   nature around the globe, posted the video to Facebook. It shows the
   falcon yawning and subsequently looking straight into the camera.

   By Wednesday afternoon the video had registered 4,500 likes and
   counting.

   "It's almost like a photo bomb," den Haan said, laughing, adding the
   camera is set up through explore.org to capture the northern lights.

   "It's kind of fun that at night you get the northern lights and during
   the day you're getting this bird."

   According to den Haan, the falcon was there long before the camera, and
   because birds are territorial it keeps coming back. The height of the
   tower is another reason it likes to be there, she said.

   "There's not a lot of height around Churchill," she said. "The trees
   are … small so any kind of a tower would be preferable for the bird to
   sit on."

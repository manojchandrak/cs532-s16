Space Ape Games Partners With Hasbro For Transformers Mobile Games

   Posted on February 10, 2016 at 1:42 pm by [60]Silver Optimus under
   [61]Video Games
   [62]Transformers Earth Wars Windblade

   Earlier [63]we brought you the news of Transformers: Earth Wars with
   special courtesy from good folks at Space Ape Games, Hasbro and
   Backflip Studios. You’ll be curious to know how this partnership came
   to be. It just so happens that Games Industry; an online magazine
   dedicated to the business aspect of video games, has come up with a
   lengthy article highlighting the new licence agreement and the future
   of the Transformers Video Games. They’ve also published images of
   couple of upcoming characters and both of them being Fembots.

   “I think the movie game tie-ins that categorised the later generation
   of console development don’t really work for mobile,” says [Simon Hade;
   co-founder of Space Ape Games]. “You can’t have thoe external
   dependencies driving the game so rigidly. You get some examples of
   studios that can build a franchise and turn out sequels regularly, but
   for the most part a good studio wants to ship a game when it’s ready.
   So you want to pick an IP and a strategy that work together, where you
   can take advantage of the fact that your game is going to be recognised
   and downloaded by a lot of people because it’s a Transformers game, but
   you also want to add to the brand, bring something new to it. At the
   same time you don’t to have to tie yourself to a movie release or an E3
   announcement. I don’t think that model will be what defines IP games on
   mobile in the way that it did on console.

   You can learn a lot more from [64]Games Industry.

       Is this a thing? If it is, here's a new trailer for it. If this
       isn't already a thing, then it is now.

       Still works in the same way. (IE attacking a stationary base with
       units you tap to spawn in). Main difference is the setting and the
       transformers skin
       Still doesn't remove the point that it's a reskin of another
       popular Appstore game.

       Nothing worse than having to wait to accumulate coins. I'll play
       with my figures instead

       The game uses a lot of Generations, Combiner Wars and Even Titans
       Return character models!
       Notice: Titans Return Blaster, Combiner Wars Skydive and
       Generations jetfire.

       Um...Castle Crashers is a side-scroller beat-'em-up for PC and
       console...

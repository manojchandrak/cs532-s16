Shoppers 'fail to spot cheapest deals'

   By Kevin Peachey Personal finance reporter
     * 11 February 2016
     * From the section [65]Business

   Milk in supermarket

   Most grocery shoppers are unable to identify the cheapest deals when
   faced with a blizzard of "special offers" in stores, financial experts
   say.

   The Money Advice Service asked just over 2,000 consumers to select the
   best value deals from four sets of offers.

   Only 2% of those asked answered all four questions correctly.

   In the survey, 76% of those asked said they spent more than they
   intended, after being enticed by special offers, paying an average £11
   extra per shop.

   Later on Thursday, Sainsbury's announced that it would phase out
   multi-buy promotions by August 2016.

   It said that because people were shopping more frequently, it would
   replace multi-buy offers with lower regular prices that allowed
   customers to buy in the quantities they wanted.

   Sainsbury's Marketing Director, Sarah Warby said customers had told
   them they found multi-buy promotions "confusing" and created
   "logistical challenges at home in terms of storage and waste."
   Media captionWhy are so many shoppers bamboozled by supermarket special
   offers?

   The government-backed Money Advice Service said shoppers should look at
   the price per unit to compare costs. It also suggested making, and
   sticking to a shopping list.

   John Penberthy-Smith, customer director for the Money Advice Service,
   said: "The problem is that quite often we see a special offer at the
   supermarket and we don't want to miss out - so we throw it into our
   trolley without really thinking about whether it is a good deal or
   whether we actually need it. Often deals can be difficult to understand
   and compare with other prices."

   Competition authorities have previously [66]accused stores of
   misleading tactics.

   In July, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had found
   evidence during a three-month investigation that supermarkets were
   misleading customers with confusing pricing promotions.

   The investigation came after a complaint by the consumer group Which?,
   but the supermarket industry said the vast majority of offers
   represented a good deal for customers.

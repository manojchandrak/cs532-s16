   [89]Submitted by Gail Tverberg via Our Finite World blog,

   I approach the subject of the physics of energy and the economy with
   some trepidation. An economy seems to be a [90]dissipative system, but
   what does this really mean? There are not many people who understand
   dissipative systems, and very few who understand how an economy
   operates. The combination leads to an awfully lot of false beliefs
   about the energy needs of an economy.

   The primary issue at hand is that, as a dissipative system, every
   economy has its own energy needs, just as every forest has its own
   energy needs (in terms of sunlight) and every plant and animal has its
   own energy needs, in one form or another. A hurricane is another
   dissipative system. It needs the energy it gets from warm ocean water.
   If it moves across land, it will soon weaken and die.

   There is a fairly narrow range of acceptable energy levels–an animal
   without enough food weakens and is more likely to be eaten by a
   predator or to succumb to a disease. A plant without enough sunlight is
   likely to weaken and die.

   In fact, the effects of not having enough energy flows may spread more
   widely than the individual plant or animal that weakens and dies. If
   the reason a plant dies is because the plant is part of a forest that
   over time has grown so dense that the plants in the understory cannot
   get enough light, then there may be a bigger problem. The dying plant
   material may accumulate to the point of encouraging forest fires. Such
   a forest fire may burn a fairly wide area of the forest. Thus, the
   indirect result may be to put to an end a portion of the forest
   ecosystem itself.

   How should we expect an economy to behave over time? The pattern of
   energy dissipated over the life cycle of a dissipative system will
   vary, depending on the particular system. In the examples I gave, the
   pattern seems to somewhat follow what Ugo Bardi calls a Seneca Cliff.
   [91]Figure 1. Seneca Cliff by Ugo Bardi

   Figure 1. Seneca Cliff by [92]Ugo Bardi

   The Seneca Cliff pattern is so-named because long ago, [93]Lucius
   Seneca wrote:

     It would be some consolation for the feebleness of our selves and
     our works if all things should perish as slowly as they come into
     being; but as it is, increases are of sluggish growth, but the way
     to ruin is rapid.

   The Standard Wrong Belief about the Physics of Energy and the Economy

   There is a standard wrong belief about the physics of energy and the
   economy; it is the belief we can somehow train the economy to get along
   without much energy.

   In this wrong view, the only physics that is truly relevant is the
   thermodynamics of oil fields and other types of energy deposits. All of
   these fields deplete if exploited over time. Furthermore, we know that
   there are a finite number of these fields. Thus, based on the Second
   Law of Thermodynamics, the amount of free energy we will have available
   in the future will tend to be less than today. This tendency will
   especially be true after the date when “peak oil” production is
   reached.

   According to this wrong view of energy and the economy, all we need to
   do is design an economy that uses less energy. We can supposedly do
   this by increasing efficiency, and by changing the nature of the
   economy to use a greater proportion of services. If we also add
   renewables (even if they are expensive) the economy should be able to
   get along fine with very much less energy.

   These wrong views are amazingly widespread. They seem to underlie the
   widespread hope that the world can reduce its fossil fuel use by 80%
   between now and 2050 without badly disturbing the economy. The
   book 2052: A Forecast for the Next 40 Years by Jorgen Randers seems to
   reflect these views. Even the “Stabilized World Model” presented in the
   1972 book [94]The Limits to Growth by Meadow et al. seems to be based
   on naive assumptions about how much reduction in energy consumption is
   possible without causing the economy to collapse.

   The Economy as a Dissipative System

   If an economy is a dissipative system, it needs sufficient energy
   flows. Otherwise, it will collapse in a way that is analogous to
   animals succumbing to a disease or forests succumbing to forest fires.

   The primary source of energy flows to the economy seems to come through
   the leveraging of human labor with supplemental energy products of
   various types, such as animal labor, fossil fuels, and electricity. For
   example, a man with a machine (which is made using energy products and
   operates using energy products) can make more widgets than a man
   without a machine. A woman operating a computer in a lighted room can
   make more calculations than a woman who inscribes numbers with a stick
   on a clay tablet and adds them up in her head, working outside as
   weather permits.

   As long as the quantity of supplemental energy supplies keeps rising
   rapidly enough, human labor can become increasingly productive. This
   increased productivity can feed through to higher wages. Because of
   these growing wages, tax payments can be higher. Consumers can also
   have ever more funds available to buy goods and services from
   businesses. Thus, an economy can continue to grow.

   Besides inadequate supplemental energy, the other downside risk to
   continued economic growth is the possibility that diminishing returns
   will start making the economy less efficient. These are some examples
   of how this can happen:
     * Deeper wells or desalination are needed for water because aquifers
       deplete and population grows.
     * More productivity is needed from each acre of arable land because
       of growing population (and thus, falling arable land per person).
     * Larger mines are required as ores of high mineral concentration are
       exhausted and we are forced to exploit less productive mines.
     * More pollution control devices or higher-cost workarounds (such as
       “renewables”) are needed as pollution increases.
     * Fossil fuels from cheap-to-extract locations are exhausted, so
       extraction must come from more difficult-to-extract locations.

   In theory, even these diminishing returns issues can be overcome, if
   the leveraging of human labor with supplemental energy is growing
   quickly enough.

   Theoretically, technology might also increase economic growth. The
   catch with technology is that it is very closely related to energy
   consumption. Without energy consumption, it is not possible to have
   metals. Most of today’s technology depends (directly or indirectly) on
   the use of metals. If technology makes a particular type of product
   cheaper to make, there is also a good chance that more products of that
   type will be sold. Thus, in the end, growth in technology tends to
   allow more energy to be consumed.

   Why Economic Collapses Occur

   Collapses of economies seem to come from a variety of causes. One of
   these is inadequate wages of low-ranking workers (those who are not
   highly educated or of managerial rank). This tends to happen because if
   there are not enough energy flows to go around, it tends to be the
   wages of the “bottom-ranking” employees that get squeezed. In some
   cases, not enough jobs are available; in others, wages are too
   low. This could be thought of as inadequate return on human labor–a
   different kind of low Energy Return on Energy Invested ([95]EROEI) than
   is currently analyzed in most of today’s academic studies.

   Another area vulnerable to inadequate energy flows is the price level
   of commodities. If energy flows are inadequate, prices of commodities
   will tend to fall below the cost of producing these commodities. This
   can lead to a cutoff of commodity production. If this happens, debt
   related to commodity production will also tend to default. Defaulting
   debt can be a huge problem, because of the adverse impact on financial
   institutions.

   Another way that inadequate energy flows can manifest themselves is
   through the falling profitability of companies, such as the falling
   revenue that banks are now experiencing. Still another way that
   inadequate energy flows can manifest themselves is through falling tax
   revenue. Governments of commodity exporters are particularly vulnerable
   when commodity prices are low. Ultimately, these inadequate energy
   flows can lead to bankrupt companies and collapsing governments.

   The closest situation that the US has experienced to collapse is the
   Depression of the 1930s. The Great Recession of 2007-2009 would
   represent a slight case of inadequate energy flows–one that could be
   corrected by a large dose of Quantitative Easing (QE)(leading to the
   lower cost of borrowing), plus debt stimulus by China. These helped
   bring oil prices back up again, after they fell in mid-2008.
   [96]Figure 1. World Oil Supply (production including biofuels, natural
   gas liquids) and Brent monthly average spot prices, based on EIA data.

   Figure 2. World Oil Supply (production including biofuels, natural gas
   liquids) and Brent monthly average spot prices, based on EIA data.

   Clearly, we are now again beginning to experience the effects of
   inadequate energy flows. This is worrying, because many economies have
   collapsed in the past when this situation occurred.

   How Energy Flows of an Economy are Regulated

   In an economy, the financial system is the regulator of the energy
   flows of the system. If the price of a product is low, it dictates that
   a small share of energy flows will be directed toward that product. If
   it is high, it indicates that a larger share of energy flows will be
   directed toward that product. Wages follow a similar pattern, with low
   wages indicating low flows of energy, and high wages indicating higher
   flows of energy. Energy flows in fact “pay for” all aspects of the
   system, including more advanced technology and the changes to the
   system (more education, less time in the workforce) that make advanced
   technology possible.

   One confusing aspect to today’s economy is the use of a “pay you later”
   approach to paying for energy flows. If the energy flows are inadequate
   using what we would think of as the natural flows of the system, debt
   is often used to increase energy flows. Debt has the effect of
   directing future energy flows in a particular direction, such as paying
   for a factory, a house, or a car. These flows will be available when
   the product is already part of the system, and thus are easier to
   accommodate in the system.

   The use of increasing debt allows total “demand” for products of many
   kinds to be higher, because it directs both future flows and current
   flows of energy toward a product. Since factories, houses and cars are
   made using commodities, the use of an increasing amount of debt tends
   to raise commodity prices. With higher commodity prices, more of the
   resources of the economy are directed toward producing energy products.
   This allows for increasing energy consumption. This increased energy
   consumption tends to help flows of energy to many areas of the economy
   at the same time: wages, taxes, business profitability, and funds for
   interest and dividend payments.

   The need for debt greatly increases when an economy begins using fossil
   fuels, because the use of fossil fuels allows a step-up in lifestyle.
   There is no way that this step-up in lifestyle can be paid for in
   advance, because the benefits of the new system are so much better than
   what was available without fossil fuels. For example, a farmer raising
   crops using only a hoe for a tool will never be able to save up
   sufficient funds (energy flows) needed to pay for a tractor. While it
   may seem bizarre that banks loan money into existence, this approach is
   in fact essential, if adequate energy flows are to be available to
   compensate for the better lifestyle that the use of fossil fuels makes
   possible.

   Debt needs are low when the cost (really energy cost) of producing
   energy products is low. Much more debt is needed when the cost of
   energy extraction is high. The reason more debt is needed is because
   fossil fuels and other types of energy products tend to leverage human
   labor, making human labor more productive, as mentioned previously. In
   order to maintain this leveraging, an adequate quantity of energy
   products (measured in British Thermal Units or Barrels of Oil
   Equivalent or some similar unit) is needed.

   As the required price for energy-products rises, it takes ever-more
   debt to finance a similar amount of energy product, plus the higher
   cost of homes, cars, factories, and roads using the higher-cost
   energy. In fact, with higher energy costs, capital goods of all kinds
   will tend to be more expensive. This is a major reason why the ratio of
   debt to GDP tends to rise as the cost of producing energy products
   rises. At this point, in the United States it takes approximately $3 of
   additional debt to increase GDP by $1 (author’s calculation).
   [97]Figure 1. Inflation adjusted Brent oil prices (in 2014$, primarily
   from BP Statistical Review of World Energy) shown beside two measures
   of debt for the US economy. One measure of debt is all inclusive; the
   other excludes Financial Business debt. Both are based on data from
   FRED -Federal Reserve of St. Louis.

   Figure 3. Inflation adjusted Brent oil prices (in $2014, primarily from
   BP Statistical Review of World Energy) shown beside two measures of
   debt for the US economy. One measure of debt is all-inclusive; the
   other excludes Financial Business debt. Both are based on data from
   FRED-Federal Reserve of St. Louis.

   Clearly one of the risk factors to an economy using fossil fuels is
   that debt levels will become unacceptably high.

   A second risk is that debt will stop rising fast enough to keep
   commodity prices at an acceptably high level. The recent slowdown in
   the growth of debt (Figure 3) no doubt contributes to current low
   commodity prices.

   A third risk to the system is that the rate of economic growth will
   slow over time because even with the large amount of debt added to the
   system, the leveraging of human labor with supplemental energy will not
   be sufficient to maintain economic growth in the face of diminishing
   returns. In fact, it is clearly evident that US economic growth has
   trended downward over time (Figure 4).
   [98]Figure 3. US annual growth rates (using "real" or inflation
   adjusted data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis).

   Figure 4. US annual growth rates (using “real” or inflation adjusted
   data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis).

   A fourth risk is that the whole system will become unsustainable. When
   new debt is issued, there is no real matching with future energy flow.
   For example, will the wages of those taking on debt to pay for college
   be sufficiently high that the debtors can afford to have families and
   buy homes? If not, their lack of adequate income will be one of the
   factors that make it difficult for the prices of commodities to stay
   high enough to encourage extraction.

   One of the issues in today’s economy is that promises of future energy
   flows extend far beyond what is formally called debt. These promises
   include shareholder dividends and payments under government programs
   such as Social Security and Medicare. Reneging on promises such as
   these is likely to be unpopular with citizens. Stock prices are likely
   to drop, and private pensions will become unpayable. Governments may be
   overthrown by disappointed citizens.

Examples of Past Collapses of Economies

   Example of the Partial Collapse of the Former Soviet Union

   One recent example of a partial collapse was that of the Former Soviet
   Union (FSU) in December 1991. I call this a partial collapse, because
   it “only” involved the collapse of the central government that held
   together the various republics. The governments of the individual
   republics remained in place, and many of the services they provided,
   such as public transportation, continued. The amount of manufacturing
   performed by the FSU dropped precipitously, as did oil extraction.
   Prior to the collapse, the FSU had serious financial problems. Shortly
   before its collapse, the world’s leading industrial nations [99]agreed
   to lend the Soviet Union $1 billion and defer repayment on $3.6 billion
   more in debt.

   A major issue that underlay this collapse was a fall in oil prices to
   the $30 per barrel range in the 1986 to 2004 period. The Soviet Union
   was a major oil exporter. The low price had an adverse impact on the
   economy, a situation similar to that of today.
   [100]Figure 4. Oil production and price of the Former Soviet Union,
   based on BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2015.

   Figure 5. Oil production and price of the Former Soviet Union, based on
   BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2015.

   Russia continued to pump oil even after the price dropped in 1986. In
   fact, it raised oil production, to compensate for the low price (energy
   flow it received per barrel). This is similar to the situation today,
   and what we would expect if oil exporters are very dependent on these
   energy flows, no matter how small. Oil production didn’t fall below the
   1986 level until 1989, most likely from inadequate funds for
   reinvestment. Oil production rose again, once prices rose.

   Figure 6 shows that the FSU’s consumption of energy products started
   falling precipitously in 1991, the year of the collapse–very much a
   Seneca Cliff type of decline.
   [101]Figure 5. Former Soviet Union energy consumption by source, based
   on BP Statistical Review of World Energy Data 2015.

   Figure 6. Former Soviet Union energy consumption by source, based on BP
   Statistical Review of World Energy Data 2015.

   In fact, consumption of all fuels, even nuclear and hydroelectric, fell
   simultaneously. This is what we would expect if the FSU’s problems were
   caused by the low prices it was receiving as an oil exporter. With low
   oil prices, there could be few good-paying jobs. Lack of good-paying
   jobs–in other words, inadequate return on human labor–is what cuts
   demand for energy products of all kinds.

   A drop in population took place as well, but it didn’t begin until
   1996. The decrease in population continued until 2007. Between 1995 and
   2007, population dropped by a total of 1.6%, or a little over 0.1% per
   year. Before the partial collapse, population was rising about 0.9% per
   year, so the collapse seems to have reduced the population growth rate
   by about 1.0% per year. Part of the drop in population was caused by
   excessive alcohol consumption by some men who had lost their jobs
   (their sources of energy flows) after the fall of the central
   government.

   When commodity prices fall below the cost of oil production, it is as
   if the economy is cold because of low energy flows. Prof. Francois
   Roddier describes the point at which collapse sets in as the point of
   self-organized criticality. According to Roddier (personal
   correspondence):

     Beyond the critical point, wealth condenses into two phases that can
     be compared to a gas phase and a liquid phase. A small number of
     rich people form the equivalent of a gas phase, whereas a large
     number of poor people form what corresponds to a liquid phase. Like
     gas molecules, rich people monopolize most of the energy and have
     the freedom to move. Embedded in their liquid phase, poor people
     have lost access to both energy and freedom. Between the two, the
     so-called middle class collapses.

   I would wonder whether the ones who die would be equivalent to the
   solid state. They can no longer move at all.

   Analysis of Earlier Collapses

   A number of studies have been performed analyzing earlier collapses.
   Turchin and Nefedov in [102]Secular Cycles analyze eight pre-fossil
   fuel collapses in detail. Figure 7 shows my interpretation of the
   pattern they found.
   [103]Figure 7. Shape of typical Secular Cycle, based on work of Peter
   Turkin and Sergey Nefedov in Secular Cycles.

   Figure 7. Shape of typical Secular Cycle, based on work of Peter
   Turchin and Sergey Nefedov in [104]Secular Cycles.

   Again, the pattern is that of a Seneca Cliff. Some of the issues
   leading to collapse include the following:
    1. Rising population relative to farmland. Either farmland was divided
       up into smaller plots, so each farmer produced less, or new workers
       received “service” type jobs, at much reduced wages. The result was
       falling earnings of many non-elite workers.
    2. Spiking food and energy prices. Prices were high at times due to
       lack of supply, but held down by low wages of workers.
    3. Rising need for government to solve problems (for example, fight
       war to get more land; install irrigation system so get more food
       from existing land). Led to a need for increased taxes, which
       impoverished workers could not afford.
    4. Increased number of nobles and high-level administrators. Result
       was increased disparity of wages.
    5. Increased debt, as more people could not afford necessities.

   Eventually, the workers who were weakened by low wages and high taxes
   tended to succumb to epidemics. Some died in wars. Again, we have a
   situation of low energy flows, and the lower wage workers not getting
   enough of these flows. Many died–in some cases as many as 95%. These
   situations were much more extreme than those of the FSU. On the
   favorable side, the fact that there were few occupations back in
   pre-industrial days meant that those who did survive could sometimes
   resettle with other nearby communities and continue to practice their
   occupations.

   Joseph Tainter in [105]The Collapse of Complex Societies talks about
   the need for increasing complexity, as diminishing returns set in. This
   would seem to correspond to the need for increased government services
   and an increased role for businesses. Also included in increased
   complexity would be increased hierarchical structure. All of these
   changes would leave a smaller share of the energy flows for the
   low-ranking workers–a problem mentioned previously.

   [106]Dr. Tainter also makes the point that to maintain complexity,
   “Sustainability may require greater consumption of resources, not
   less.”

   A Few Insights as to the Nature of the Physics Problem

   The [107]Second Law of Thermodynamics seems to work in a single
   direction. It talks about the natural tendency of any “closed” system
   to degenerate into a more disordered system. With this view, the
   implication is that the universe will ultimately end in a heat-death,
   in which everything is at the same temperature.

   Dissipative systems work in the other direction; they create order
   where no order previously existed. Economies get ever-more complex, as
   businesses grow larger and more hierarchical in form, governments
   provide more services, and the number of different jobs filled by
   members of the economy proliferate. How do we explain this additional
   order?

   According to [108]Ulanowicz, the traditional focus of thermodynamics
   has been on states, rather than on the process of getting from one
   state to another. What is needed is a theory that is more focused on
   processes, rather than states. He writes,

     .  .  . the prevailing view of the second law is an oversimplified
     version of its true nature. Simply put, entropy is
     not entirely about disorder. Away from equilibrium, there is an
     obverse and largely unappreciated side to the second law that, in
     certain circumstances, mandates the creation of order.

   We are observing the mandated creation of order. For example, the human
   body takes heat energy and transforms it to mechanical energy. There is
   a dualism to the entropy system that many have not stopped to
   appreciate. Instead of a trend toward heat death always being the
   overarching goal, systems have a two-way nature to them. Dissipative
   systems are able to grow until they reach a point called self-organized
   criticality or the “critical point”; then they shrink from inadequate
   energy flows.

   In forests, this point of self-organized criticality comes when the
   growth of the tall trees starts blocking out the light to the shorter
   plants. As mentioned earlier, at that point the forest starts becoming
   more susceptible to forest fires. [109]Ulanowicz shows that for

   If we look at world per capita energy consumption, it seems to indicate
   a very narrow “window of viability” as well.
   [112]Figure 9. World energy consumption per capita, based on BP
   Statistical Review of World Energy 2105 data. Year 2015 estimate and
   notes by G. Tverberg.

   Figure 9. World energy consumption per capita, based on BP Statistical
   Review of World Energy 2105 data. Year 2015 estimate and notes by G.
   Tverberg.

   When we look at what happened in the world economy alongside the
   history of world energy consumption, we can see a pattern. Back prior
   to 1973, when oil was less than $30 per barrel, oil consumption and the
   economy grew rapidly. A lot of infrastructure (interstate highways,
   electric transmission lines, and pipelines) was added in this
   timeframe. The 1973-1974 price shock and related recession briefly
   brought energy consumption down.

   It wasn’t until the restructuring of the economy in the late 1970s and
   early 1980s that energy consumption really came down. There were many
   changes made: cars became smaller and more fuel efficient; electricity
   production was changed from oil to other approaches, often nuclear;
   regulation of utilities was changed toward greater competition, thus
   discouraging building infrastructure unless it was absolutely
   essential.

   The drop in energy consumption after 1991 reflects the fall of the
   Former Soviet Union. The huge ramp-up in energy consumption after 2001
   represents the effect of adding China (with all of its jobs and coal
   consumption) to the World Trade Organization. With this change, energy
   needs became permanently higher, if China was to have enough jobs for
   its people. Each small dip seems to represent a recession. Recently
   energy consumption seems to be down again. If we consider low
   consumption along with low commodity prices, it makes for a worrying
   situation. Are we approaching a major recession, or worse?

   If we think of the world economy relative to its critical point, the
   world economy has been near this point since 1981, but various things
   have pulled us out.

   One thing that has helped the economy is the extremely high interest
   rate (18%) implemented in 1981. This high interest rate pushed down
   fossil fuel usage at that time. It also gave interest rates a very long
   way to fall. Falling interest rates have a very favorable impact on the
   economy. They encourage greater lending and tend to raise the selling
   prices of stocks. The economy has received a favorable boost from
   falling interest rates for almost the entire period between 1981 and
   the present.

   Other factors were important as well. The fall of the Soviet Union in
   1991 bought the rest of the world a little time (and saved oil
   extraction for later); the addition of China to the World Trade
   Organization in 2001 added a great deal of cheap coal to the energy
   mix, helping to bring down energy costs. These low energy costs, plus
   all of the debt China was able to add, allowed energy consumption and
   the world economy to grow again–temporarily pulling the world away from
   the critical point.

   In 2008, oil prices dropped very low. It was only with QE that interest
   rates could be brought very low, and commodity prices bounced back up
   to adequate levels. Now we are again faced with low prices. It looks as
   if we are again at the critical point, and thus the edge of collapse.

   Once a dissipative structure is past its critical point, Roddier says
   that what is likely to bring it down is an avalanche of bifurcations.
   In the case of an economy, these might be debt defaults.

   In a dissipative structure, both communication and stored information
   are important. Stored information, which is very close to technology,
   becomes very important when food is hard to find or energy is high cost
   to extract. When energy is low-cost to extract, practically anyone can
   find and make use of energy, so technology is less important.

   Communication in an economy is done in various ways, including through
   the use of money and debt. Few people understand the extent to which
   debt can give false signals about future availability of energy flows.
   Thus, it is possible for an economy to build up to a very large size,
   with few realizing that this approach to building an economy is very
   similar to a [113]Ponzi Scheme. It can continue only as long as energy
   costs are extremely low, or debt is being rapidly added.

   In theory, EROEI calculations (comparing energy produced by a device or
   energy product to fossil fuel energy consumed increasing this product)
   should communicate the “value” of a particular energy product.
   Unfortunately, this calculation is based the common misunderstanding of
   the nature of the physics problem that I mentioned at the beginning of
   the article. (This is also true for similar analyses, such as Lifecycle
   Analyses.) These calculations would communicate valuable information,
   if our problem were “running out” of fossil fuels, and if the way to
   mitigate this problem were to use fossil fuels as sparingly as
   possible. If our problem is rising debt levels, EROEI and similar
   calculations do nothing to show us how to mitigate the problem.

   If the economy collapses, it will collapse down to a lower sustainable
   level. Much of the world’s infrastructure was built when oil could be
   extracted for $20 per barrel. That time is long gone. So, it looks like
   the world will need to collapse back to a level before fossil
   fuels–perhaps much before fossil fuels.

   If it is any consolation, Prof. Roddier says that once new economies
   begin to form again, the survivors after collapse will tend to be more
   co-operative. In fact, he offers this graphic.
   [114]Figure 10. F. Roddier view of what happens on the two sides of the
   critical point. From upcoming translation of his book, "The
   Thermodynamics of Evolution."

   Figure 10. F. Roddier view of what happens on the two sides of the
   critical point. From upcoming translation of his book, “The
   Thermodynamics of Evolution.”

   We know that if there are survivors, new economies will be likely. We
   don’t know precisely what they will be like, except that they will be
   limited to using resources that are available at that time.

   Basic flaw in the argument.... Loss of cheap oil does not mean that all
   that has been built before would disappear. It just means that progress
   becomes difficult. ie the standard of living essentially stops where it
   is.

   Can't say I read much of this, because Tverberg's articles are
   typically overlong syllogisms and as such they are tiresome.

   And I very much doubt Tverberg expected to see $30 a barrel oil and an
   oil glut in 2016.

   One meme put forward that I viscerally disagree with is that the
   economic downturn (collapse?) has anything directly to do with oil.

   TPTB would like to say, "everything has gone to hell because the oil
   ran out.  Blame yourselves for using it all up!!"

   This is utter nonsense.  The central planners running the show are
   incompetent, greedy and venial.

   Agreed. The debt comes first. When debt creation outpaces economic
   growth, it automatically pulls extra demand, for everything, from the
   future. You can't extract the extra oil overnight, so oil prices go up
   and feeds the the bad debt growth. The author is confusing
   cycles(intentionally?). There is no honest 'energy' transfers via
   debt-based currency, the inflation is always sending false signals. The
   more debt created, the larger the amplitude of variation e.g., see
   McMansions selling for 10 cents on the dollar of debt for cash at
   foreclosure. When people starve to death, it won't be for lack of
   energy. It will be due to all the mal-investments that weren't allowed
   to clear because TPTB have acquired too way much control over the
   economy's finances, like welfare state transfer payments.

   More intellectual hot air that could have been explained in a few
   paragraphs.

   Monetary currency is the energy. Borrowed currency for future return
   can only produce so much product before there is too much product and
   the borrowed currency can not be paid back. Peak debt is here. I still
   get all kinds of calls and junk mail to borrow more. You would think
   that at this precarious point of peak debt collapse that credit would
   not be offered without being asked for. In essence, I am  constantly
   being begged to borrow.

   What? Am I stupid? I should take on debt so you can take my house or
   the assets of my business which can't even pay me a salary? Perfect
   plan to lend me pretend money hoping I can't pay it back. Then the take
   possession of real assets when I default.

   Water - thousands across the globe die each day from drinking
   non-potable water, because they have no other source.  Tesla (I'm
   guessing you mean the man, not the shitty corp) didn't leave very good
   plans behind, if he was even on the right track.  Deep abiotic oil that
   replenishes at what rate again...? Durh.

   Permaculture for 7 billion - Nope, that's just silly.  Gardens and
   small farms will feed some, not all.  We will all get less of BAU from
   here out, because we've had declining energy available per capita for
   20+ years now.  Debt and monetary inflation has masked this for a
   while, sometimes well and sometimes not so well.  But it's ending even
   as we type.

   Another flaw is not accounting for the relative value of the dollar
   over time or the major changes caused by social media and
   entertainment. Add on factory relocation and productivity in creating
   products using improved engineering and robots. The standard of living
   will fall - but mainly because we can produce more products with fewer

   If you cull selectively but sensibly, you can reduce the population by
   60-80%.

   E.g., Eliminate the <100 IQ, the genetically defective (keep passing on
   shitty genes), the violent criminals, those >80, too sick, the Central
   Bankers... and you're there.  Especially if you get rid of most of the
   foodchain in the 3rd world, who would not have lived w/o our modern
   medicines, or Ebola intervention.

   In the end, you want healthy, smart people, who are not psychos, wackos
   or cruel.  I'd imagine that this is what TPTB and Luciferians have in
   mind, to reduce the human population to a healthy size that's more in
   aligned with dwindling resources and increasing pollution.  The FEMA
   camps make for perfect Selection places for these assessments.  Hey,
   you gotta die sometime anyway!

   Pink Floyd / The Wall

   China's shiney new Two-Child Policy, announced right before COP21,
   means China has no intention of being 'gotten rid of'. I think it means
   "we did our part now ROW you're gonna be doing yours like it or not. We
   drink your milkshake." I also think it was their attempt to put
   population on top of the agenda in Paris when the "professional liars
   and immaculate hypocrites" wouldn't put on their big-boy pants ie:
   unable to develop better political science capable of the magnitude of
   the challenge.

   Notice the talk around Zika is directed at pregnancy... (tin foil hat
   territory LOL)

   The only democratic way to cull sensibly is a global zero-child policy,
   part of which is a global lottery.

   The other flaw relates to why economies fail.  It's no secret.
   Whenever you have borrowed more from the future than can possibly be
   paid back by any reasonable or expected economic growth; At that point
   - the zero point on the margin - the collapse begins.

     There's so much excess capacity in the system.  From financials to
   services, and into commodities, because central banks have encouraged
   wreckless spending for yield seekers.

    Lets talk about the real problem... Misalocation of capital, hidden
   inflation -- healthcare, student loan debt, wage stagnation, loss of
   productivity/manufacturing jobs, entitlements, ect... I could go on for
   hours on this topic.

   Can we have permission to just replace this long winded pile of shit
   article with your "Lets talk about the real problem... Misalocation of
   capital, hidden inflation -- healthcare, student loan debt, wage
   stagnation, loss of productivity/manufacturing jobs, entitlements,
   ect... I could go on for hours on this topic."


   Because as noone5 below points out - bless him, the only greater

   giant waste of time writing this long article of nonsense.

   I will agree with the last two sentences of the article.  I lived thru
   "peak oil"...."peak debt".....now I'm waiting for "peak toilet
   paper".   People been brainwashed for 50 years with the phrase "peak
   oil".  It's extremely hard to remove that thought from their mind.
   "Saudi Arabians are our friends" is another learned phrase over a long
   period of time.  I think we are about to enter a strange new world.
   It's going to be one hell of a reset.  I would like to think peoples
   morals will also get reset.  In the 1930s people all felt they were in
   it together and most tried to help each other when they could.  Can you
   see that happening now?  Attitudes have changed.  Think about roving
   armed gangs.  They will exist now.  Law enforcement may be gangs.

   I just watched Mad Max Fury Road and they seemed to get along (energy
   wise) just fine. Ha!

   The thought that keeps coming back into my mind is that when the
   collapse hits....the best one can do is band together with a group of
   neighbors.  A group will be mandatory for survival.  Most parts of the
   country (cities) will require groups.  There are a few exceptions where
   people can be self sustaining.

   To agree to everything in the article is to go back to Jimmy Carter
   days.  Drive 55mph max. because we are running out of oil...maybe
   tomorrow.  Al Gore who wants to make a $trillion off global warming.
   Banks who want war.  Oby sure gave us hope.  The list is endless.

   What a long way to say that a reduction of 80-90% of the population
   must take place to balance energy, food, water against consumption to
   sustain life over the long run.

   Didn't the Germans have an answer to this awhile back?  There are
   countless energy sources becoming available.  Overproduction is
   currently a way larger problem.  Japan learned takes several decades to
   get the normal economy restored.  One would think the rest of the world
   would have been watching and learned.

   If over population with regard for food, shelter, water could be
   addressed by new energy sources alone, all 9-10-11  billion of us could
   survive

   Post 2050 the world population will be declining. Once per capita
   income goes above $4K a year humans reproduce below replacement rate.


   Human populations will decline to match available resources if we see
   to it that most folks are "rich" (relative to human history).

   It's actually a devastating article it pretty much says we're fooked.

   He's mentioning in there IF there are survivors.  I realize it's long
   but trust me I have a wee bit of experience sorting the wheat from the
   chaff here he's basically saying that this could well on get completely
   out of hand.

   Most of us tend to have normalcy biases built around our lives we've
   all grown up in a world that can't exist becasue well it isn't
   sustainable.

   A lot of us including me think we know what that means but as per the
   article we really do not know what that means.

   It means in essence a mass conversion back to subsitence farming from
   what he's saying.

   Now don't get me wrong I find it unfathomable to believe he said that
   but that's more or less what he's saying.

   Think about it logically and I have for quite some time, the system is
   so complex and so interwoven that those who have are not going to be
   willing to stop off at some lower sustainable level that is higher for
   all.

   Nope people will claw and fight tooth and nail to keep what they have
   and it'll push the sustainable set point down much farther than any of
   us now are imagining.

   There is a reason the rich built all those bunkers.

   I'll take you word for it that you read it all.  So you think it
   predicts the fall of the Roman empire redux?  I would think the Windup
   Girl world is more probable but who knows, an asteroid could hit,
   nuclear war could start, cold fusion could work, the horse could sing.

   This 'fixed technology' bullshit - making speculative but declarative
   statements about limitations predicated on the assumption of little or
   no change in the technology underpinning economic activity - is the
   hallmark of dilettante (journalistic) understanding of economics and of
   production.

   Oil is the only energy source? For someone who claims to grok physics,
   the author has no fucking idea about technological change.

   It's as stupid as asserting, circa 1850, that it is impossible for man
   to cover ground as fast as a horse because man only has 2 legs.

   I've seen stuff that's almost as bad - like fucktards who think that in
   order to build an AI that will surpass human-level cognition, it will
   have to be constructed along the same lines as a human brain.

   To understand why that's retarded... ask yourself: what is the right
   answer to 'How can I move much faster than a horse?'

   It is absolutely not "Grow two more legs, and a mane, and eat lots of
   grass."

   The right answer is "Dig up some special dirt, melt it, cool it, and
   press or mold it it into a variety of shapes, and put those shapees
   together into a bigger shape that looks nothing like a horse. Then dig
   up some brown ooze, refine it, put it in a receptacle within the new
   non-horse-shaped thing. Then progressively-explode the refined brown
   ooze under pressure, and capture the released energy through an
   ingenious system of cams and shafts. Use less-refined brown ooze to
   make sure that shit doesn't stick together when it gets hot."

   Funnily enough, that's almost the same answer for "How do I fly faster
   than a falcon, and farther than a migrating goose?".

   Answer: "Dig up some different types of dirt, melt it, cool it, and
   make a tube out of it. Fill the tube with explosives refined from
   different ooze, and explode the refined ooze."


   USE TECHNOLOGY. INNOVATE.


   Humans are a now trechnological species, first and foremost. We
   understand quite a lot about the planet we live on, and a fair bit the
   universe in which the planet is situated. We understand quite a lot
   about the local (i.e., planetary, resource) constraints under which we
   operate, and we understand quite a bit less about broader physical (in
   the sense of 'to do with physics') constraints.

   Even the most speculative forms of theoretical physics is quite
   'conservative' in what it will accept: physics as we currently
   understand it, almost certainly assumes more constraints than will
   eventually prove to be the case.

   With that said... the amount of energy that is floating around
   uncaptured by our current technology, is staggering.

   I know this sounds New Age-y, and it annoys me that the internet
   abounds with the (citation-free) assertion that Feynman and Wheeler
   'calculated' that there is sufficient energy in a seemingly-empty
   coffee cup, to boil the world's oceans; usually this reference is made
   on hippy-dippy sites plugging ZPE ('zero point energy') as something
   currently-accessible (which it's not).

   However one thing in irrefutable: zero-point energy exists and is
   absolutely abundant. We cannot currently harness it, but doing so would
   not violate any of the known laws of physics - in other words it is not
   'unharnessable'... which means that we will learn how to harness it.


   In the same way, APM (atomically-precise manufacture) does not violate
   any known physical laws, and will, once implemented, reduce the energy
   requirements of manufacture by a factor of (roughly) ten thousand. So
   eventually it will be a thing, and the cost of manufactured goods will
   fall to near-zero.

   Feynman gave a lecture on this in 1959 called "[366]There's PLENTY of
   Room at the Bottom" - he forecast integrated circuits in that lecture,
   and guessed that you should be able to etch the contents of an
   Encyclopaedia on the head of a pin without serious technological
   challenge (and by using a 7-bit encoding, you could fit all of the book
   in the world in a cube a quarter-inch across).


   We will have APM; we will have Strong AI (which will arise from
   something that is radically different from a human brain in both its
   structure and its function); we will have zero-point energy (not in a
   hippy-dippy way); we will go past the Singularity - and we will do all
   those things in my lifetime.

   Literally the only caveat to this, is that the parasite political class
   might weaponise the technology first. This is why they have to be got
   rid of - non-violently if possible, but violently if necessary.


   And OIL? Who the fuck cares? It's not going to matter a fucking iota
   within a generation; we will be dragging CO[2] out of the atmosphere in
   order to recover the carbon to build shit with (by the by - that's why
   'carbon emissions' would not be a problem even if it's true that human
   carbon emissions cause climate change: but it's not true anyhow).

   Polls show that Donald Trump is poised for another big win in South
   Carolina, which hosts the next Republican primary on Feb. 20.

   The latest RealClearPolitics average of recent polls in the critical
   early-voting state show the bombastic billionaire with 36% support.

   His next closest rival, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, has the support of only
   19.7% Palmetto State Republicans.

   But despite his large anticipated margin of victory in South Carolina,
   as well as a “yuge” win in New Hampshire Tuesday, Trump still faces an
   uphill battle for the nomination.

   Following the South Carolina contest, candidates face grueling contests
   on March 1, March 5, March 6, March 8 and March 15, during which more
   than 20 states, as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico,
   will head to the polls.

   Several Republican establishment candidates, like Rubio and Ohio Gov.
   John Kasich, appear to fare better in polls in many of those states.

   On the Democratic side, meanwhile, Hillary Clinton — despite only a
   razor-thin victory in the Iowa caucuses and a blowout loss in New
   Hampshire to Bernie Sanders — remains the front-runner in South
   Carolina, whose moderate Democrats have long been seen as a way to stop
   the bleeding in the former secretary of state’s campaign.

   According to the latest RealClearPolitics average, Clinton is up over
   Sanders in the Palmetto State 62% to 32.5%.

EEF and Royal Society partner to improve science results for disadvantaged
pupils

   10 February 2016
   Education research

   The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) - in partnership with the
   Royal Society - will be investigating ways to improve science results
   for disadvantaged pupils in primary and secondary schools across
   England, it was announced today.

   The organisations are jointly commissioning a review of the current
   evidence about science education in formal education settings for young
   people. The review will identify the most promising approaches and
   programmes which can support young people to achieve key educational
   outcomes in science, with a particular focus on pupils from
   economically disadvantaged backgrounds.

   The review will also analyse the existing evidence to help teachers and
   schools identify the most effective approaches to raise the attainment
   of their pupils in science. These might include programmes that focus
   on professional development for teachers, individual and small-group
   interventions; and support at home.

   The attainment gap in English schools is well documented: the latest
   figures show just 33.1% of all young people classified as disadvantaged
   achieved the expected standard of 5 good GCSEs, compared to 60.9% of
   all other pupils. Although the data suggests that the link between
   economic disadvantage and attainment in science is no stronger in
   science than in other subjects, the Royal Society’s report SES and
   Science Education (2008) suggested the gap “may be more persistent over
   time in science”.

   The EEF and Royal Society are seeking proposals from research teams
   able to complete this review by July 2016. The deadline for proposals
   is 9am on 4 March 2016. The full invitation to tender can be accessed
   at [60]https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/evaluation/science/

   The literature review will be published later this year.

   Sir Kevan Collins, Chief Executive of the Education Endowment
   Foundation, said today:

   “The data is clear. Pupils from disadvantaged homes are much less
   likely than their peers to achieve 5 good GCSE results. We believe that
   helping schools to use evidence and understand better the most
   effective ways to improve results is the best way to tackle this
   country’s stark attainment gap.

   “I’m pleased that EEF is partnering with the Royal Society who are
   offering funding, support and advice. Together, we hope to be able to
   identify the most promising ways to tackle the attainment gap in
   science.”

   Professor Tom McLeish FRS, Chair of the Royal Society’s Education
   Committee, said:

   “Science is at the heart of modern life and provides the foundations
   for economic prosperity. In a world increasingly dependent on
   scientific and technological advances, it is absolutely vital that
   every UK citizen has a good science education grounding. It’s also of
   absolute importance that young people from all backgrounds are given
   the chance to do well in and enjoy these subjects.

   “The Royal Society is excited to be working on this project with EEF -
   it’s a first and vital step towards to understanding how we can help
   give disadvantaged students the means to improve their science results
   and expand their horizons.”

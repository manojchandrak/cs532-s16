Bass Says China Bank Losses May Top 400% of Subprime Crisis

   Kyle Bass: China's Banking System Is in Big Trouble
     * Manager says 10% asset loss would cut equity by $3.5 trillion
     * China would have to print $10 trillion to recapitalize banks

   Kyle Bass, the hedge fund manager who successfully bet against
   mortgages during the subprime crisis, said China’s banking system may
   see losses of more than four times those suffered by U.S. banks during
   the last crisis.

   Should the Chinese banking system lose 10 percent of its assets because
   of nonperforming loans, the nation’s banks will see about $3.5 trillion
   in equity vanish, Bass, the founder of Dallas-based Hayman Capital
   Management, wrote in a letter to investors obtained by Bloomberg. The
   world’s second-biggest economy may end up having to print more than $10
   trillion of yuan to recapitalize banks, pressuring the currency to
   devalue in excess of 30 percent against the dollar, according to Bass.
   Are China's Banks Heading for Disaster?

   Bass, 46, scored big after betting against mortgages in 2007, racking
   up gains as the world’s largest banks wrote off more than $80 billion
   in subprime losses. All his calls haven’t been as prescient. He
   revealed wagering on a collapse in Japan’s government-bond market in
   2010, a short position that Bass later acknowledged that other bond
   investors had nicknamed “the widow maker.”

Largest Resetting

   “What we are witnessing is the resetting of the largest macro imbalance
   the world has ever seen,” he wrote in the letter. “Credit in China has
   reached its near-term limit, and the Chinese banking system will
   experience a loss cycle that will have profound implications for the
   rest of the world.”

   [106]QuickTake China's Debt Bomb

   Bass said his hedge fund has sold most of its riskier assets since the
   middle of last year to position itself for 18 months of “various events
   that are likely to transpire along this long road to a Chinese credit
   and currency reset.” In an e-mailed response to questions, he said
   about 85 percent of his portfolio is invested in China-related trades.

   “The problems China faces have no precedent,” Bass wrote in the letter.
   “They are so large that it will take every ounce of commitment by the
   Chinese government to rectify the imbalances. Risk assets will not be
   the place to be while all of this is happening.”

Deceleration Pattern

   Chinese growth, which averaged 10 percent for three decades through
   2010, has decelerated for five straight years and in 2015 slowed to 6.9
   percent, the lowest rate in a quarter of a century. It will ease to 6.5
   percent this year, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. The
   economy continues to transition toward growth driven by services and
   consumption instead of manufacturing and investment, but the new
   drivers haven’t yet proven sufficient to offset the lagging older ones.

   Bass estimates the Chinese economy actually expanded last year at a
   slower pace than reported, about 3.6 percent, according to the letter.
   He estimates that of China’s $3.2 trillion in foreign-exchange
   reserves, about $2.2 trillion are liquid.

   The banking system, which he estimates swelled 10-fold in assets over
   the last decade to more than $34.5 trillion, is fraught with risky
   products used by financial companies to skirt regulations, wrote Bass.
   The nation’s expanding shadow banking system -- which he says has grown
   almost 600 percent in the last three years, citing UBS Group AG data --
   “is where the first credit problems are emerging.”

   Wealth-management products, which have been used by Chinese banks for
   off-balance sheet lending and to lure buyers with perceived guarantees
   and yields that trump the deposit rate, are being brought back onto the
   balance sheets as they begin to fail, according to Bass. He also said
   the use of trust-beneficiary rights -- the legal rights to trust
   products -- are “ticking time bombs” because they’re used by banks to
   hide loan losses.

   “We believe the epicenter of the problem is the Chinese banking system
   and its coming losses,” he wrote. “Until China experiences a
   significant devaluation, it will not be able to cope with the build-up
   of credit that has helped fuel its rise, but may, in the short-term, be
   its undoing.”

   Since his successful call betting on subprime mortgages, Bass’s
   performance has been more mixed, with his main fund returning about 1.6
   percent annualized as of last August, the New York Post reported at the
   time.

Japan, Drugs

   In 2010, Bass began publicly forecasting a collapse in
   Japan’s government-bond market. At the time, he said that it would take
   three years or so for the stress to show in Japanese bond markets. In a
   2013 interview with Bloomberg Television, Bass said he expected that
   the trade would eventually make “

   300 to 400 times our money.”

   The manager, who has challenged dozens of U.S. drug patents since early
   2015, recommended shares of the pharmaceutical company Perrigo Co. at
   an investment conference last May. The stock fell about 18 percent in
   U.S. trading from May 7, when Bass made his presentation, to Sept. 30,
   when Hayman no longer reported owning the stock in quarterly filings.

   In October, Bass said China was facing a cycle of credit contraction,
   and he predicted an emerging Asia banking crisis.

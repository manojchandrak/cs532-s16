Argentine and Brazilian doctors suspect mosquito insecticide as cause of
microcephaly

   Claire Robinson / GMWatch

   [49]Tweet

With the proposed connection between the Zika virus and Brazil's outbreak of
microcephaly in new born babies looking increasingly tenuous, Latin American
doctors are proposing another possible cause: Pyriproxyfen, a pesticide used
in Brazil since 2014 to arrest the development of mosquito larvae in drinking
water tanks. Might the 'cure' in fact be the poison?

   Malformations detected in thousands of children from pregnant women
   living in areas where the Brazilian state added Pyriproxyfen to
   drinking water are not a coincidence, even though the Ministry of
   Health places direct blame on the Zika virus.

   The World Health Organization view that the microcephaly outbreak in
   Brazil's impoverished northeast is caused by the Zika virus has, so
   far, received few challenges.

   Brazil's Health Minister, Marcelo Castro, has gone so far as to say
   that he has "100% certainty" that there is a link between Zika and
   microcephaly, a birth defect in which babies are born with small heads.

   The view is widely supported in the medical community worldwide,
   including by the US's influential Center for Disease Control. But there
   is no hard evidence of the link, rather a mixture of epidemiological
   indications and circumstantial evidence.

   One of the key [50]scientific papers, by A S Oliveira Melo et al in the
   journal Ultrasound in Obstetrics & Gynecology, found Zika virus in the
   amniotic fluids and other tissues of the affected babies and their
   mothers. But only two women were examined, far too small a number to
   establish a statistically significant link.

   The [51]New York Times also reported on 3rd February on the outcome of
   analyses by Brazil's Health Ministry: "Of the cases examined so far,
   404 have been confirmed as having microcephaly. Only 17 of them tested
   positive for the Zika virus. But the government and many researchers
   say that number may be largely irrelevant, because their tests would
   find the presence of the virus in only a tiny percentage of cases."

   And last weekend, the most powerful indicator yet that the microcephaly
   may have another cause altogether was announced by Colombia's
   president, Juan Manuel Santos, as [52]reported by the Washington Post.
   Colombian public health officials, stated Santos, have so far diagnosed
   3,177 pregnant women with the Zika virus- but in no case had
   microcephaly been observed in the foetus.

   Argentine doctors: it's the insecticide

   Now a new [53]report has been published by the Argentine doctors'
   organisation, Physicians in the Crop-Sprayed Towns (PCST), [1] which
   not only challenges the theory that the Zika virus epidemic in Brazil
   is the cause of the increase in microcephaly among newborns, but
   proposes an alternative explanation.

   According to PCST, the Ministry failed to recognise that in the area
   where most sick people live, a chemical larvicide that produces
   malformations in mosquitoes was introduced into the drinking water
   supply in 2014.

   STOP PRESS - Brazilian state [54]Rio Grande do Sul bans Pyriproxyfen
   for use in controlling Zika virus mosquitos.

   This pesticide, Pyriproxyfen, is used in a state-controlled programme
   aimed at eradicating disease-carrying mosquitos. The Physicians added
   that the Pyriproxyfen is manufactured by Sumitomo Chemical, a Japanese
   '[55]strategic partner' of [56]Monsanto. - a company they have learned
   to distrust due to the vast volume of the company's pesticides sprayed
   onto Argentina's cropland.

   Pyriproxyfen is a growth inhibitor of mosquito larvae, which alters the
   development process from larva to pupa to adult, thus generating
   malformations in developing mosquitoes and killing or disabling them.
   It acts as an insect juvenile hormone or juvenoid, and has the effect
   of inhibiting the development of adult insect characteristics (for
   example, wings and mature external genitalia) and reproductive
   development.

   The chemical has a relatively low risk profile as shown by its [57]WHO
   listing, with low acute toxicity. Tests carried out in a variety of
   animals by Sumitomo found that it was not a teratogen (did not cause
   birth defects) in the mammals it was tested on. However this cannot be
   taken as a completely reliable indicator of its effects in humans -
   especially in the face of opposing evidence.
   The PCST commented: "Malformations detected in thousands of children
   from pregnant women living in areas where the Brazilian state added
   Pyriproxyfen to drinking water are not a coincidence, even though the
   Ministry of Health places a direct blame on the Zika virus for this
   damage."
   They also noted that Zika has traditionally been held to be a
   relatively benign disease that has never before been associated with
   birth defects, even in areas where it infects 75% of the population.

   Brazilian doctors also suspect pyriproxyfen

   Pyriproxyfen is a relatively new introduction to the Brazilian
   environment; the microcephaly increase is a relatively new phenomenon.
   So the larvicide seems a plausible causative factor in microcephaly -
   far more so than [58]GM mosquitos, which some have blamed for the Zika
   epidemic and thus for the birth defects.

   The PCST report, which also addresses the Dengue fever epidemic in
   Brazil, concurs with the findings of a separate [59]report on the Zika
   outbreak by the Brazilian doctors' and public health researchers'
   organisation, Abrasco. [2]
   Abrasco also names Pyriproxyfen as a possible cause of the
   microcephaly. It condemns the strategy of chemical control of
   Zika-carrying mosquitoes, which it says is contaminating the
   environment as well as people and is not decreasing the numbers of
   mosquitoes.

   Instead Abrasco suggests that this strategy is in fact driven by the
   commercial interests of the chemical industry, which it says is deeply
   integrated into the Latin American ministries of health, as well as the
   World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organisation.
   Abrasco names the British GM insect company Oxitec as part of the
   corporate lobby that is distorting the facts about Zika to suit its own
   profit-making agenda. Oxitec sells GM mosquitoes engineered for
   sterility and markets them as a disease-combatting product - a strategy
   condemned by the Argentine Physicians as "a total failure, except for
   the company supplying mosquitoes."

   Both the Brazilian and Argentine doctors' and researchers' associations
   agree that poverty is a key neglected factor in the Zika epidemic.
   Abrasco condemned the Brazilian government for its "deliberate
   concealment" of economic and social causes: "In Argentina and across
   America the poorest populations with the least access to sanitation and
   safe water suffer most from the outbreak." PCST agrees, stating, "The
   basis of the progress of the disease lies in inequality and poverty."
   Abrasco adds that the disease is closely linked to environmental
   degradation: floods caused by logging and the massive use of herbicides
   on (GM) herbicide-tolerant soy crops - in short, "the impacts of
   extractive industries."
   The notion that environmental degradation may a factor in the spread of
   Zika finds backing in the [60]view of Dino Martins, PhD, a Kenyan
   entomologist. Martins said that "the explosion of mosquitoes in urban
   areas, which is driving the Zika crisis" is caused by "a lack of
   natural diversity that would otherwise keep mosquito populations under
   control, and the proliferation of waste and lack of disposal in some
   areas which provide artificial habitat for breeding mosquitoes."

   Community-based actions

   The Argentine Physicians believe that the best defence against Zika is
   "community-based actions". An example of such actions is featured in a
   [61]BBC News [62]report on the Dengue virus in El Salvador.

   A favourite breeding place for disease-carrying mosquitoes is storage
   containers of standing water. El Salvadorians have started keeping fish
   in the water containers, and the fish eat the mosquito larvae. Dengue
   has vanished along with the mosquitoes that transmit the disease. And
   so far, the locals don't have any Zika cases either.
   Simple yet effective programmes like this are in danger of being
   neglected in Brazil in favour of the corporate-backed programmes of
   pesticide spraying and releasing GM mosquitoes. The latter is
   completely unproven and the former may be causing far more serious harm
   than the mosquitoes that are being targeted.

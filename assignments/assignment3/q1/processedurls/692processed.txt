   WITH fishing experts predicting that the coming weeks could produce
   some of the best barra fishing in the Top End in years, the race to
   hook a $1 million catch will be on in earnest.

   But at least two Top End fishos are already laughing all the way to the
   bank, becoming the seventh and eighth people to reel in one of the 76
   $10,000 fish in the Northern Territory Government's Million Dollar Fish
   competition recently.

   Fifty-year-old self-employed concreter Lindsay Grundon was fishing with
   his long-time friend and business partner Peter Dakis at their secret
   spot on the Daly River when he hooked the 64cm prize-tagged barra that
   was the seventh caught in the competition. And Shaymus Frewen bagged a
   68cm tagged barra in Bynoe Harbour on Sunday to claim the eighth
   $10,000 fish.

   "I'm rapt. I still don't believe it," Mr Grundon said after his catch
   was verified.

   In a day to remember, Mr Grundon's winning barramundi was one of 20
   barra caught by the pair, who said they were just in the "right place
   at the right time" at the popular spot.

   "We didn't really notice the Million Dollar Fish tag at first. It
   wasn't until we put our glasses on that we could read what it said," Mr
   Grundon said.

   A regular fisherman, Mr Grundon registered for the competition at
   www.milliondollarfish.com.au last year and said he planned to pay off a
   few bills with his $10,000 prize.

   "I'll probably celebrate by fuelling up and going fishing again," he
   said.

   As for the winning fish, it's been filleted, although it won't be eaten
   by Mr Grundon. He doesn't like fish - just fishing with his best mate,
   Peter, who couldn't have been happier for "Grundo".

   "He's a good mate, we fish together, we work together. I'm just happy
   it was caught on our boat," Mr Dakis said.

   Honouring a fisherman's pact, Mr Frewen said he would be splitting the
   cash prize 50-50 with his friend Pete Turner, whose boat the pair was
   on at the time. But, he's not the only friend set to benefit from the
   winning catch.

   "We said from day one the rules of the boat were whoever is on the boat
   we'll split the prize between them," Mr Frewen said.

   "The fishing rod that I used to catch the fish belongs to a mate so
   he'll be getting 10% too. So he's getting $1000 just for having a rod
   on a boat so he's pretty stoked about it too."

   The winning catches come after record-breaking rainfall in areas of the
   Top End just before Christmas that led to the evacuation of the Daly
   River Community.

   The monsoonal weather was predicted by fishing experts to see the early
   arrival of a strong "run-off", the time of year local anglers refer to
   as the best for barramundi fishing.

   "Now the flood waters have receded, conditions are ripe for catching
   barramundi on the Daly River, which is good news for the more than
   41,000 people registered in the Million Dollar Fish competition," NT
   CEO Tony Mayell said.

   "More than half of the registrations for the competition are from
   interstate (25,503) so we strongly encourage these people to get on a
   plane, get up here and wet a line."

   To date, seven of the eight $10,000 prize-tagged fish captured have
   been caught by locals.

   With less than a month to go in the competition, Mr Mayell said the
   challenge was on for interstate anglers to get a bite of the action.

   "Fishing experts have predicted the coming weeks could be the best
   barramundi fishing the Top End has seen in years so now is the perfect
   time to book a fishing holiday to the Northern Territory - it could
   leave you a million dollars richer."

   The Million Dollar Fish competition ends at midnight on Monday,
   February 29.

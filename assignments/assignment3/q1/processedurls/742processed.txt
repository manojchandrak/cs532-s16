Twitter growth grinds to a halt

   SAN FRANCISCO — Twitter fourth-quarter performance in 140 characters or
   less? Not great.

   Shares ([70]TWTR) fell nearly 4% Thursday, the day after Twitter's
   quarterly results showed once again just how mightily the social media
   service is struggling to attract new users. In the fourth quarter, user
   growth essentially ground to a halt.

   Twitter reported it had 320 million users in the December quarter, flat
   with the previous quarter and up 9% year-over-year. Analysts expected
   Twitter to report 325 million users, up 1.5% from the third quarter.

   Excluding so-called "fast followers" who access the service via text
   message, Twitter had 305 million monthly active users in the quarter,
   up 6% year-over-year and a decline from 307 million in the previous
   quarter.

   In a letter Twitter sought to reassure shareholders. "As of the end of
   January, we have already seen total (monthly active users), excluding
   SMS Fast Followers, return to Q3 levels," the company wrote.

   Twitter's chief financial officer Anthony Noto told analysts during a
   conference call that the company has been welcoming back "resurrected"
   as well as new users. And co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey pledged to
   make significant changes to improve the Twitter service from increasing
   streaming video to getting rid of confusing rules that drive away
   users.

   Yet the lackluster numbers showed investors that Twitter's recent
   attempts under Dorsey have yet to pull the service out of a
   lengthy growth slump.

   FACEBOOK RIVALRY

   The timing isn't ideal for the nine-year-old company, which is facing
   growing investor scrutiny. While popular with media outlets,
   politicians and celebrities, Twitter has never been able to match the
   mass market appeal of Facebook which, at 1.59 billion users, is five
   times the size of Twitter. The problem: many people do not understand
   how or why they should use the service. As a result, even Instagram,
   the photo-sharing app owned by Facebook, has eclipsed Twitter with 400
   million users and a faster growth rate.

   Dorsey, who is pulling double duty as CEO of Twitter and digital
   payments company Square, has pledged to reignite growth at Twitter but
   says change won't happen overnight.

   Twitter's user growth is a key metric for investors because it suggests
   whether Twitter will be able to more effectively compete for digital
   advertising dollars against Facebook, which has about five times as
   many users.

   Facebook's advertising business dwarfs Twitter. Twitter is expected to
   capture a 9% share of global social network ad spending in 2016,
   according to research firm eMarketer. Facebook is forecast to
   have 65.1%.

   In the fourth quarter, Twitter generated $710 million in revenue, an
   increase of 48% year-over-year, in line with analyst estimates.

   Twitter earned 13 cents a share, excluding certain expenses. Analysts
   expected 12 cents a share. Including those expenses, Twitter lost 16
   cents a share. Analysts had forecast a loss of 17 cents a share.

   Twitter’s outlook was lower than Wall Street forecast. The company
   estimated revenue of $595 million to $610 million in the current
   quarter. Wall Street expected $628 million.

   "Earnings were notably better and the revenues were in line but the MAU
   number continues to be the company's nemesis," said S&P Global Market
   Intelligence analyst Scott Kessler. "We'll see how they address that
   because clearly it's the elephant in the room. They created this
   problem in more ways than one and hopefully they can figure out a way
   to either solve or address it."

   Twitter have plummeted over the last year, losing 67% of their
   value. Twitter shares closed up 4% to $14.98 in regular trading
   Wednesday, then slid 3% after hours. The company announced
   fourth-quarter results after the close of trading.

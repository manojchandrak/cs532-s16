   E-Bro carefully shares his thoughts about the new T.L.O.P. project by
   Kanye that he heard last night. Apparently the GOOD Music fam was in
   the building including Kim, North West, A$AP Rocky, Tyga and others.
   The Electric Lady studio session was rich with libations aka beverages
   and apparently everyone was feeling right.

   “We was having some beverages in there!” E-Bro said. “I was really into
   the music.”

   When speaking about what Kanye wanted to be remembered from the
   project, he paraphrased Kanye words saying, “I want you to talk about
   how amazing the music is, the drums, the bass lines and the song
   structure.”

   E-Bro also went on to talk about how Kanye had some pretty funny lines
   on the project. One particular line was about Ray J of all people, who
   was frequently brought up during the recent Wiz beef.

   According to E-Bro Kanye said, “Me and Ray J would be friends if we
   wasn’t in love with the same bitch. You might have hit it first, but
   I’m rich though.”

   “It’s not serious its funny,” E-Bro recalled as he paraphrased rap.

   What else will Kanye say? Who knows, but we will be eagerly waiting to
   hear every word of [DEL: Swish :DEL] , [DEL: Waves, :DEL] T.L.O.P.

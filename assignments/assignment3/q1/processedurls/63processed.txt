Argentine and Brazilian doctors name larvicide as potential cause of
microcephaly

   Zika Virus Outbreak in Brazil

   Are the Zika virus – and GM mosquitoes – being wrongly blamed? Report
   by Claire Robinson

   A [117]report from the Argentine doctors’ organisation, Physicians in
   the Crop-Sprayed Towns,[1] challenges the theory that the Zika virus
   epidemic in Brazil is the cause of the increase in the birth defect
   microcephaly among newborns.
   The increase in this birth defect, in which the baby is born with an
   abnormally small head and often has brain damage, was quickly linked to
   the Zika virus by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. However, according
   to the Physicians in the Crop-Sprayed Towns, the Ministry failed to
   recognise that in the area where most sick people live, a chemical
   larvicide that produces malformations in mosquitoes was introduced into
   the drinking water supply in 2014. This poison, Pyriproxyfen, is used
   in a State-controlled programme aimed at eradicating disease-carrying
   mosquitoes.
   The Physicians added that the Pyriproxyfen is manufactured by Sumitomo
   Chemical, a Japanese "[118]strategic partner" of [119]Monsanto.
   Pyriproxyfen is a growth inhibitor of mosquito larvae, which alters the
   development process from larva to pupa to adult, thus generating
   malformations in developing mosquitoes and killing or disabling them.
   It acts as an insect juvenile hormone or juvenoid, and has the effect
   of inhibiting the development of adult insect characteristics (for
   example, wings and mature external genitalia) and reproductive
   development. It is an endocrine disruptor and is teratogenic (causes
   birth defects), according to the Physicians.
   The Physicians commented: “Malformations detected in thousands of
   children from pregnant women living in areas where the Brazilian state
   added Pyriproxyfen to drinking water are not a coincidence, even though
   the Ministry of Health places a direct blame on the Zika virus for this
   damage.”
   They also noted that Zika has traditionally been held to be a
   relatively benign disease that has never before been associated with
   birth defects, even in areas where it infects 75% of the population.

Larvicide the most likely culprit in birth defects

   Pyriproxyfen is a relatively new introduction to the Brazilian
   environment; the microcephaly increase is a relatively new phenomenon.
   So the larvicide seems a plausible causative factor in microcephaly –
   far more so than GM mosquitoes, which some have blamed for the Zika
   epidemic and thus for the birth defects. There is no sound evidence to
   support the notion promoted by some sources that GM mosquitoes can
   cause Zika, which in turn can cause microcephaly. In fact, out of 404
   confirmed microcephaly cases in Brazil, only 17 (4.2%) [120]tested
   positive for the Zika virus.

Brazilian health experts agree Pyriproxyfen is suspect

   The Argentine Physicians’ report, which also addresses the Dengue fever
   epidemic in Brazil, concurs with the findings of a separate [121]report
   on the Zika outbreak by the Brazilian doctors’ and public health
   researchers’ organisation, Abrasco.[2]
   Abrasco also names Pyriproxyfen as a potential factor in the outbreak
   of microcephaly cases and calls for suspension of its use. It condemns
   the strategy of chemical control of Zika-carrying mosquitoes, which it
   says is contaminating the environment as well as people and is not
   decreasing the numbers of mosquitoes. Abrasco suggests that this
   strategy is in fact driven by the commercial interests of the chemical
   industry, which it says is deeply integrated into the Latin American
   ministries of health, as well as the World Health Organization and the
   Pan American Health Organisation.
   Abrasco names the British GM insect company Oxitec as part of the
   corporate lobby that is distorting the facts about Zika to suit its own
   profit-making agenda. Oxitec sells GM mosquitoes engineered for
   sterility and markets them as a disease-combatting product – a strategy
   condemned by the Argentine Physicians as “a total failure, except for
   the company supplying mosquitoes”.

The poor suffer most

   Both the Brazilian and Argentine doctors’ and researchers' associations
   agree that poverty is a key neglected factor in the Zika epidemic.
   Abrasco condemned the Brazilian government for its "deliberate
   concealment” of economic and social causes: “In Argentina and across
   America the poorest populations with the least access to sanitation and
   safe water suffer most from the outbreak.” The Argentine Physicians
   agreed, stating, “The basis of the progress of the disease lies in
   inequality and poverty.”
   Abrasco added that the disease is closely linked to environmental
   degradation: floods caused by logging and the massive use of herbicides
   on (GM) herbicide-tolerant soy crops – in short, “the impacts of
   extractive industries”.
   The notion that environmental degradation may a factor in the spread of
   Zika finds backing in the [122]view of Dino Martins, PhD, a Kenyan
   entomologist. Martins said that “the explosion of mosquitoes in urban
   areas, which is driving the Zika crisis” is caused by “a lack of
   natural diversity that would otherwise keep mosquito populations under
   control, and the proliferation of waste and lack of disposal in some
   areas which provide artificial habitat for breeding mosquitoes”.

Community-based actions

   The Argentine Physicians believe that the best defence against Zika is
   “community-based actions”. An example of such actions is featured in a
   BBC News [123]report on the Dengue virus in El Salvador. A favourite
   breeding place for disease-carrying mosquitoes is storage containers of
   standing water. El Salvadorians have started keeping fish in the water
   containers, and the fish eat the mosquito larvae. Dengue has vanished
   along with the mosquitoes that transmit the disease. And so far, the
   locals don’t have any Zika cases either.
   Simple yet effective programmes like this are in danger of being
   neglected in Brazil in favour of the corporate-backed programmes of
   pesticide spraying and releasing GM mosquitoes. The latter is
   completely unproven and the former may be causing far more serious harm
   than the mosquitoes that are being targeted.

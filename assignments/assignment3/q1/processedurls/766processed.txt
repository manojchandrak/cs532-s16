Bicycle Queensland calling for urgent action on cycling safety with release
of new bikeway plans

   10 February 2016

   Stanley St Bikeway

   Bicycle Queensland is calling on all parties contesting the upcoming
   council elections to commit to saving lives by funding the construction
   of a major separated bikeway along one of Brisbane’s busiest and most
   dangerous roads.

   Plans were today unveiled for the Stanley Street bikeway that would
   stretch 1.2 kilometres from the Gabba to the Goodwill Bridge at South
   Bank.

   The proposed bikeway would create a critical infrastructure link that
   would allow thousands of people to cycle safely in a part of
   inner-Brisbane that is used by 45,000 vehicles per day.

   Commencing at the corner of Ipswich Road and Stanley St, the two-way
   route would provide bike riders with separation from vehicles all the
   way along the busy traffic corridor, linking with South Bank, the
   Kangaroo Point Bikeway and the Goodwill Bridge to the CBD.

   The plan also includes expanded pedestrian zones, newly paved areas,
   sculpture opportunities, a public plaza, and trees and shelters for
   shade to enhance Brisbane’s reputation as a new world city.

   Bicycle Queensland CEO Ben Wilson urged Brisbane’s Lord Mayoral
   candidates to throw their support behind the proposal and commit to the
   construction of the bikeway in their election promises.

   “This commitment is relatively low in cost and in traffic implications,
   and is a golden opportunity to make a part of Brisbane rideable for the
   thousands of people in the rapidly growing Woolloongabba area and
   inner-eastern suburbs,” said Mr Wilson.

   “Separated bikeways make riding so much safer and have a proven record
   of getting people taking up cycling for transport, which relieves
   congestion.”

   “This bikeway’s value-for-money is sensational and critically important
   to the city.”

   “The project will lift this busy Stanley Street corridor from an ugly,
   hostile and dangerous road into a pleasant place to live, dine, commute
   by bike and walk along by creating a new buffer- boulevard.”

   The plan will also address some of the key recommendations made by the
   coroner in December following an inquest into the death of bike rider
   Rebekka Meyer at the Stanley Street/Annerley Road intersection in 2014.

   Coroner Christine Clements recommended that more dedicated, exclusive
   bikeways be planned and developed across Brisbane to prevent a similar
   tragedy occurring, particularly at this location.

   Mr Wilson said that not only will this bikeway address that
   recommendation, it will also incorporate the recommendation to widen
   the pedestrian crossing across Stanley Street, giving riders a safe,
   alternative route into Annerley Road

   “It’s definitely a hotspot area with people riding from the city to the
   University of Queensland, a key bike route that accommodates up to
   1,000 bicycle riders every day,” said Mr Wilson.

   “This plan improves the safety of bike riders at the intersection by
   providing segregation and a dedicated space with minimal disruption to
   general traffic or commerce.”

   The project is the central plank of Bicycle Queensland’s plan to make
   Brisbane a city where bike riding is a normal and safe activity for
   all.

   Other key requests ahead of the upcoming election include:
     * An increase in council’s future bikeway commitments from the
       current $30m p.a. to $40m p.a. (ie  25 cent raise per Brisbane
       resident per week to walking and cycling infrastructure)
     * A CBD planning process to allow north-south and east-west
       segregated bikeways through the inner city by 2018
     * Engage with innovative trials of new and world class designs to get
       more space for cycling on important roads
     * Update the Brisbane Bicycle Network Plan and set a firm target of
       near-completion of the Brisbane network by 2024

#Letthemstay protesters on Eastern Freeway

   [c55befa069f2e32cb16b6e98570f7fee?width=650] Refugee protesters hang
   over the Eastern Freeway this morning. Picture: Hamish Blair

   TWO protesters abseiled from a bridge across the Eastern Freeway this
   morning to unfurl a protest banner reading #letthemstay as heavy
   peak-hour traffic passed underneath.

   Police and fire crews were on the scene to remove the protesters, but
   the pair lowered themselves down at 11.30am.

   The pair were spoken to by police, who will make further inquiries, but
   have so far avoided arrest.

   The protesters were photographed — and themselves shared photographs on
   social media — at the Yarra Bend bridge near the city end of one of
   Melbourne’s busiest motorways.

   The protests were part of a nationwide action calling on the Federal
   Government to halt the deportation of refugees to Nauru.

   Teachers across Melbourne joined the action in recent days,
   [238]holding protests on school grounds.

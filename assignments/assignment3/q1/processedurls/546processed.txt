   Students at Skyline High School are learning life lessons through
   floral design. (Published Wednesday, Feb. 10, 2016)

   For eight years, Shawn Coyle has taught floral design at Dallas ISD's
   Skyline High School.

   "I run my classroom like a business," said Coyle.

   As part of the course, the students run a year-round flower shop. They
   arrange and sell flowers for special school programs, dances and staff
   member anniversaries.

   But there is no busier week than the one leading up to Valentine's Day.

   "It's crazy," said junior Clarissa Lopez. "It's a lot of work and a lot
   of guys order flowers at the last minute for their girlfriends."

   "Love and emotions are high in high school and we just sort of meet
   that expectation," said Coyle.

   By week's end, students will arrange and deliver more than 2,000
   flowers. But the focus is about more than building bouquets.

   "We work with the money and talk to the students," said senior Jaha
   Gray. "We work on our communication skills. It's really beneficial."

   Already, several students have used the experience to get paying jobs
   at area florists.

   "You know the skills you learned in school were valuable because you
   can use them to go somewhere else," said Lopez. "I get rewarded for
   doing something I love, so it's not like I'm really working if I love
   to do it."

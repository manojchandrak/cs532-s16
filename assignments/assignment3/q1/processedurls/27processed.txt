   On Tuesday, I was on a Black Lives Matter panel at the Facebook
   headquarters in Palo Alto. It was a private event just for Facebook
   employees. The campus was amazing and it was a cool experience to be
   able to see where a platform that I love and use so much is managed on
   a day to day basis. What I will remember most, though, were several
   private discussions that I had with both Facebook staff members and a
   very respected member of our panel.

   Without fail, each of them expressed to me that they actually really,
   really like Bernie Sanders. They said that their own personal political
   views lined up way more with his than they did with Hillary Clinton’s
   or any of the Republican candidates. They said they loved that Bernie
   was against the death penalty and for raising the minimum wage to $15
   an hour. Bernie, to them, is pretty damn amazing.

   In spite of all of that, they were pretty sure, though, that they were
   going to vote for Hillary Clinton.

   [27]BERNIE SANDERS CRUSHES HILLARY CLINTON IN N.H. PRIMARY

   When I asked why in the world they would go against their own views and
   preferences, I always got some version of the same answer:

   “Bernie Sanders could not win in a general election.”

   Not a single one of them had any hard demographic data or poll results
   or inside information that caused them to believe this. Instead, their
   views were all hinged on conventional wisdom.

   I get it.

   Eight years ago, 16 years ago, I don’t think Bernie Sanders could’ve
   won the Democratic nomination, much less the Presidential election, but
   2016 is different.

At the Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto many staff members discussed how
much they liked Bernie Sanders.

   Conventional wisdom has its place, but in this political climate, it’s
   a poor substitute for an accurate prediction. Let me make the case for
   how Bernie Sanders becomes the next American president.

   Young People & Women

   Yesterday, in New Hampshire, an [28]astounding 84% of young people ages
   17 to 29 voted for Bernie Sanders. 82% of young women under the age of
   30 voted for Bernie yesterday in New Hampshire.

   The [29]same numbers were true in Iowa. Young voters aren’t just
   marginally breaking for Bernie — it’s not even close.

   It’s not just super young voters who love and respect Bernie Sanders,
   either. In Iowa, voters ages 30 to 44 chose Bernie over Hillary [30]by
   a 21% margin. In New Hampshire, this demographic [31]was even more
   pronounced — Bernie won voters ages 30 to 44 by a 66% to 32% margin. On
   Tuesday, in a widely shared op-ed for The Guardian, RoseAnn DeMoro
   [32]said, “I’m a woman and I will vote for the best feminist for
   president: Bernie Sanders. I won’t vote against Hillary Clinton because
   she’s female, but I don’t intend to vote for her because I am. We need
   more fundamental changes in this country.”

   presidential nominee because Bernie Sanders could not win in a general
   election. Darren McCollester/Getty Images

Many voters say they will vote for Hillary Clinton as the Democratic
presidential nominee because Bernie Sanders could not win in a general
election.

   The Trust Factor

   We live in an age where people just don’t trust conventional
   politicians. Bernie Sanders, though, may be the most trusted politician
   in America.

   Asked which politician was “honest and trustworthy,” New Hampshire
   voters chose Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton 91% to 5%. Remember,
   Hillary only lost the state by 21%, so what we’re seeing is that even
   huge volumes of her own voters [33]admit they actually trust Bernie
   more. That is almost identical to what I heard from my conversations at
   Facebook.

   In fact, polls have determined that Bernie Sanders is the only
   candidate from either party with [34]a net positive favorability
   rating.

   Guess who the three least liked candidates are nationally? In this
   order — Donald Trump, Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton.

   FULL COVERAGE:[35]THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

   Just as Democrats of every persuasion will rally against someone like
   Donald Trump, Republicans of every persuasion will do so against
   Hillary Clinton. This notion that come a general election Clinton is
   going to become someone that the majority of Americans trust or have a
   favorable view on just isn’t based in fact.

   Independents

   An increasing number of Americans don’t closely identify themselves
   with any political party. Bernie Sanders is the longest serving
   Independent congressman in the history of America. When he speaks of
   being free from corporate interests, he has been able to say this for
   so long, in great part, by also staying free from the burdensome
   restraints of the Democratic party. This is what gave him the freedom
   to vote against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is what gave him
   the freedom to vote against the draconian welfare bill famously touted
   by Bill Clinton. This is how he has been able to continue to say he’s
   against the death penalty. Bernie Sanders has been independent his
   entire political career and has received virtually zero support from
   the party elites this primary season.

   Consequently, independents are coming out for Bernie in big numbers —
   which is essential in any Presidential election. In New Hampshire,
   [36]72% of Independents broke for Bernie. In Iowa he [37]won 69% of
   Independents.

   Head to Head, Bernie Does Better

   In every available poll showing Bernie Sanders running against every
   Republican candidate and Hillary Clinton running against those
   candidates, Bernie outperforms Hillary in all of them. This was true in
   [38]October. This was true in [39]December. It was true in [40]January.
   Some key Republican leaders are actually starting to say they think
   [41]they’d prefer to go against Hillary.

Pinkerton Academy Stockbridge Theatre in Derry, N.H. on Monday.

   While the Bernie Sanders campaign has worked hard to promote these head
   to head polls, the information just hasn’t trickled down enough for
   people on the ground to know that this is the case.

   Prominent African-American voters are turning toward Bernie

   Bernie Sanders, particularly compared to Hillary Clinton, has not been
   well known for very long among most African-Americans. As people have
   time to investigate and understand the differences between the two, the
   tide will start to really turn.

   Just today, Ta-Nehisi Coates, perhaps the most respected and widely
   read author of issues important to black voters, [42]said he intends to
   vote for Bernie Sanders.

   Michelle Alexander, the legal scholar who authored “The New Jim Crow,”
   which may be the most quoted and leaned on book of the Black Lives
   Matter Movement, [43]wrote a scathing op-ed entitled, “Hillary Clinton
   Does Not Deserve the Black Vote.”

Ta-Nehisi Coates, perhaps the most respected and widely read author of issues
important to black voters, said he intends to vote for Bernie Sanders.

   Ben Jealous, the former head of the NAACP, and a widely respected and
   connected organizer, endorsed Bernie Sanders last week and [44]has been
   working full-force on the campaign trail.

   And the Rev. Al Sharpton met with Bernie at Sylvia’s, a Harlem soul
   food mecca, on Wednesday morning, just hours after Bernie’s commanding
   win in New Hampshire.

a scathing op-ed entitled, “Hillary Clinton Does Not Deserve the Black Vote.”

   While no single individual represents or speaks for all of black
   America, these four men and women are among the most respected,
   trusted, experienced leaders and thinkers in the country. Cornel West,
   another leading scholar, has already been on the trail with Bernie for
   months.

   When the leading scholars, thinkers, and organizers are starting to
   break for Bernie, it will have a ripple effect.

   In my opinion, the candidate who people trust, who strongly wins the
   youth and independent vote, who beats the opponents better head to
   head, and who earnestly garners the support of African-Americans, is a
   winning candidate.

   It seems crazy that a 74-year-old man who has called himself a
   Democratic Socialist for most of his life could become our next
   president, but the path is clear, and it is very possible.

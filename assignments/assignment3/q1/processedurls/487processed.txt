Deftones’ Chino Moreno Shares Soundtrack Of His Life, Finds Coldplay “The
Most Boring Music In The World”

   Deftones frontman Chino Moreno has been doing the press rounds in the
   UK recently and the below stop at [22]NME was one of them. He took part
   in their ‘Soundtrack Of My Life’ series, detailing the songs that
   influenced him, the songs that make him danced and more. When asked
   what song he wished he wrote, he upped the ante, stating that he wished
   he wrote Weezer‘s ‘Blue Album’:

     “A whole record I wish we had written is the ‘Blue Album’ from
     Weezer. The song’s are so simple in a way, but they just penetrate.
     It’s just a great record. And I remember sitting back and saying man
     I wish I was that band and I wish I’d wrote this batch of songs,
     ’cause they’re so fun to play and so fun to sing. Early on we used
     to do covers of ’em—we used to actually soundcheck with that whole
     record back like on the early days of “Adrenaline” and stuff and
     people used to bug out, like here we are in this metal band and
     we’re sitting here soundchecking with the whole first Weezer
     record.”

   In reply to a song that he can’t get out of his head, Moreno [23]once
   again gave props to Justin Bieber, stating:

     “Recently a song that I can’t get out of my head is… actually any
     song by Justin Bieber. I end up by default listening to his latest
     singles every morning when I’m driving my daughter to school. So his
     most recent one is probably “What Do You Mean?” and it’s like it
     just replays in my head all day long. I hear it one time in the
     morning and it’s like the rest of the day I’m stuck with it—which I
     don’t really mind too much—I mean, I don’t think it’s that bad of a
     song.”

   When asked what song he can no longer listen to, he chose Coldplay:

     “One band I just can’t listen to is Coldplay. I don’t know why. They
     spring no emotion at all to me. Any of their songs, I hear them, and
     there’s just the most blank sound that I’ve heard. I’m not trying to
     be an asshole in any way. I just really… it does absolutely nothing
     for me, it’s gotta be the most boring music in the world.”

   The Deftones‘ next album “Gore” will be released on April 08th.

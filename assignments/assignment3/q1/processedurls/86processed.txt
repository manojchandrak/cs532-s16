Tesla stock is finally having a good day after unveiling 2016 plans

   by Jackie Wattles   [88]@jackiewattles February 11, 2016: 12:37 PM ET

   Elon Musk: Model 3 'will eventually be made in China'

Tesla still isn't turning a profit. But the carmaker boosted its delivery
guidance when it posted earnings, sending its shares up 13% in after hours
trading.

   In his [90]letter to shareholders, CEO Elon Musk confirmed that Tesla
   plans to deliver at least 80,000 vehicles in 2016 and raised the high
   end of the guidance to 90,000, quelling investor fears that the company
   may not be able ramp up production to meet demand.

   Deliveries are a key metric for the company because it gauges how
   quickly Tesla is producing its electric cars and getting them to
   customers that placed orders for them.

   In a conference call Wednesday, Musk said the company has been focused
   on meeting that challenge rather than boosting sales. But in 2016, that
   will be different. He projected that sales will grow between 60% and
   80% in the year ahead.

   "The last several months have been quite excruciating I'd say, a lot of
   late nights and weekends, but I'd say we're through the woods a bit at
   this point," Musk said.

   raises safety concern

   Musk said Model S deliveries were up 76% from the same quarter last
   year, and he doesn't anticipate any hangups with Tesla's new Model X
   SUV. It began delivering those vehicles in late 2015, and Musk said
   Tesla is "now significantly increasing Model X production."

   Tesla ([92]TSLA) spent billions of dollars investing in a new factory
   and other capital projects in 2015, and the company ended the fourth
   quarter $114 million in the red. Analysts had expected it to post a
   small profit of $3.89 million.

   [93]Related: Tesla's worst nightmare ... cheap gas

   But Musk plans to turn a profit before the end of 2016. In the coming
   months, Tesla's massive new Gigafactory will kick into a higher gear by
   producing batteries for cars and home energy storage, as well as new
   Tesla Energy products.

   There's also the Model 3 to look forward to. At $35,000 before tax
   breaks, it's about half the price of the basic version of the Model S.
   The Model 3 could be Tesla's key to the mass market. It'll [94]start
   taking deposits from buyers on March 31.

   But the company does face challenges. The company in the past has
   overestimated its delivery projections, and demand for electric cars
   may be sluggish if gas stays stubbornly cheap.

   It'll also see new competition. General Motors is likely to start
   selling the all-electric Chevy Bolt early next year, at a roughly
   comparable price.

   It's been a[95] rough year for Tesla stock. Before the company posted
   earnings, its shares were down 38.4% year-to-date.

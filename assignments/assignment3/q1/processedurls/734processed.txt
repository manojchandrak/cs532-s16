   Laura Hillier (pictured), who had leukemia, died after waiting for a
   bed to become available in a Canadian hospital for a bone marrow
   transplant

   Laura Hillier (pictured), who had leukemia, died after waiting for a
   bed to become available in a Canadian hospital for a bone marrow
   transplant

   A girl who died of leukemia was given a final send off after her
   friends signed her casket with loving messages on January 30.

   Laura Hillier got to experience a few normal childhood milestones like
   graduating high school and getting her senior year book signed before
   she died on January 20.

   Laura might have experienced a few more milestones if a Hamilton,
   Ontario, [68]Canada, hospital had been able to accommodate a bone
   marrow transplant for the young woman.

   Numerous donors were a match with Laura and ready to donate, but
   Hamilton's Juravinski Hospital didn't have enough beds in
   high-air-pressure rooms for the procedure.

   Hospital staff told her they had about 30 patients with potential
   donors, but the means to only do about five transplants a month.

   Laura was first diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia at age 13.

   She had been completely cancer-free for approximately four years after
   her first battle with AML, and relapsed this past May.

   Though Laura was able to achieve remission for a second time, she
   relapsed again in November 2015.

   Dr. Ralph Meyer, Juravinski's vice-president of oncology and palliative
   care, told Ontario's [69]TheStar.com there are plenty of others facing
   the same situation as Laura in Canada.

   He said donor registries are growing in size, and technological
   advances allow transplants to safely happen between people who are less
   of a match for each other are becoming more and more common.
   Laura's friends signed her casket in a final good bye at her funeral
   ten days after she died on January 20

   'It is crazy to have to be on a wait-list when you have a donor and you
   are ready to go,' Laura told TheStar.com in July of 2015.

   Putting off the surgery meant Laura had to endure her fifth round of
   painstaking chemotherapy.

   After her death in January, her obituary slammed Canada's bed shortage
   as having 'deadly wait times':

   'In Laura's last year with us, she was determined to bring public
   attention to the problem of deadly wait times for bone marrow
   transplants in Ontario and across Canada.

   'In July 2015, Laura achieved remission for the second time from acute
   myeloid leukemia and was blessed to have a perfect donor match.

   'However, she found out that she would not be able to receive her
   life-saving transplant for months as there were many waiting ahead of
   her and not enough resources to handle the demand.'

   After her death, the outpouring of love was so great for Laura, her
   family asked some people to only attend the visitation, rather than the
   funeral, because they were worried about running out of room.

   Friends of the musical theater-loving teen came out in droves, signing
   the casket in marker, talking about her life and singing songs.

   'Though Laura's casket was a beautiful sentiment from her friends and
   family, Laura's fight, and now our fight, is to change the medical
   system to end the deadly wait times for patients requiring a bone
   marrow transplant,' a post on the Hope for Laura Hillier Facebook page
   said.

       AVAILABLE FOR USA *** Will Ferrell and Christina Aguilera bring
       their Tight Pants to The Tonight Show. Will Ferrell returned to the
       late night chat show with a new rendition of the classic Tight
       Pants sketch. Appearing in the mop-top wig and form-fitting white
       trousers, the familiar melody soon hits finding Ferrell doing the
       twist and singing. "Everybody's lookin' at my tight pants," Ferrell
       sings and after a beat, he's joined by Christina Aguilera who adds
       a nice harmony to the performance. The two celebrate the tightness
       of their pants but when host Jimmy Fallon joins the circle, things
       take a dark turn. After a brief moment, it looks like Fallon is
       encroaching on their space and soon the question of Aguilera's
       fidelity - she plays Ferrell's wife in the skit - comes into play.
       The question of paternity soon passes as the Fallon exits the
       segment, leaving everyone to imagine how a baby can be 'swaddled in
       the tightest of pants' 'Everybody's talking bout my tight pants!'

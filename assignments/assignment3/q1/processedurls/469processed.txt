FSG's message to Liverpool supporters

   [71]LFC
     *
     *
     *
     *
     *

   Principal Owner John W Henry, Chairman Tom Werner and President Mike
   Gordon have tonight issued the following message to Liverpool
   supporters...

   Dear Liverpool supporters,

   It has been a tumultuous week. On behalf of everyone at Fenway Sports
   Group and Liverpool Football Club, we would like to apologise for the
   distress caused by our ticket pricing plan for the 2016-17 season.

   The three of us have been particularly troubled by the perception that
   we don’t care about our supporters, that we are greedy, and that we are
   attempting to extract personal profits at the club’s expense. Quite the
   opposite is true.

   From our first days as owners we have understood that serving as
   custodians of this incredible institution is a distinct privilege and
   as such, we have been driven solely by the desire to return LFC to the
   pinnacle of football. In the world of modern football, growing the club
   in a sustainable way is essential to realising this objective.

   To that end, we have never taken a single penny out of the football
   club. Instead we have injected vast sums of our own money to improve
   the playing squad and modernise LFC’s infrastructure - exemplified by
   the £120million advance from FSG to build the new Main Stand. This
   massive undertaking was made in order to provide more supporters access
   to Anfield and also to produce additional revenue to help us compete
   financially with clubs that have greater resources. When it opens in
   August this year, the stand will accomplish those goals, thereby
   fulfilling a promise we made upon acquiring LFC in 2010.

   We were strongly engaged in the process to develop the ticketing plan
   for 2016-17. We met directly with representatives of LFC’s Supporters’
   Committee and along with LFC management, wholeheartedly agreed with
   major concerns raised, notably: access for local and young supporters;
   engagement and access to Anfield for local children; access to Premier
   League matches for those in Liverpool most challenged by
   affordability.

   We believe the plan successfully addressed these concerns and are
   disappointed that these elements have been either lost or, worse,
   characterised as cynical attempts to mask profiteering in the plan as a
   whole. Rather, we prefer to look at them as the parts of the ticketing
   plan we got right.

   On the other hand, part of the ticketing plan we got wrong.

   In addition to the other elements of the plan we proposed price
   increases on a number of tickets. These pricing actions generated
   growth in general admission ticketing revenue on a like-for-like basis
   exclusive of revenue from newly-added GA seats.

   We believed by delivering a vastly improved seat offering in what will
   be the newest stand in English football, concentrating the price
   increases on those tickets typically purchased by fans least sensitive
   to affordability, and highlighting the need for LFC to begin repaying
   the £120million advance from FSG for the new Main Stand that these
   increases were supportable even in the context of growth in revenues
   from the new Premier League TV deal.

   However, the widespread opposition to this element of the plan has made
   it clear that we were mistaken.

   A great many of you have objected strongly to the £77 price level of
   our most expensive GA seats and expressed a clear expectation that the
   club should forego any increased revenue from raising prices on GA
   tickets in the current environment.

   Message received.

   After an intense period of consultation with LFC management we have
   decided to make major revisions to our ticketing structure for 2016-17:
     * Removal of game categorisation – regardless of the opposition fans
       will pay the same price for matchday tickets.
     * The pricing of tickets will be readjusted to result in zero revenue
       growth from GA ticketing on a like-for-like basis.
     * Though individual ticket prices may move marginally from this
       season, we are freezing our 2016-17 GA ticket revenue at the
       2015-16 level exclusive of newly-added seats in the new Main Stand.
     * The price of our highest general admission ticket will be frozen at
       the 2015-16 level - £59.
     * The price of our highest season ticket will be frozen at the
       2015-16 level - £869. The lowest price reducing a further £25 from
       the 2015-16 level to £685, as well as all other tiers being frozen
       or reduced.
     * £9 GA seats will be offered for each and every Premier League
       match, an allocation of more than 10,000 tickets across the season.

   We would hasten to add that the other initiatives announced last week
   in the 2016-17 plan will remain:
     * 17-21 young adult concession – 20,000 tickets across the Premier
       League season available at a 50 per cent reduction for young
       people.
     * 1,000 tickets to Premier League matches across the season will be
       given away free of charge to Liverpool schoolchildren based on
       merit, as recommended by their teachers.

   As a sign of our commitment to this improved ticketing structure, we
   are further announcing that this plan shall be in effect for both the
   2016-17 and 2017-18 seasons. For the next two seasons, LFC will not
   earn a single additional pound from increasing general admission ticket
   prices.

   We believe we have demonstrated a willingness to listen carefully,
   reconsider our position, and act decisively. The unique and sacred
   relationship between Liverpool Football Club and its supporters has
   always been foremost in our minds. It represents the heartbeat of this
   extraordinary football club.

   More than any other factor by far, that bond is what drives us to work
   tirelessly on behalf of the club and its future. We have great
   conviction in our world-class manager and our young, talented squad and
   know that in time the on-pitch success we all crave will be realised.

   We look forward to sharing in that success with you.

   John W Henry, Tom Werner, Mike Gordon

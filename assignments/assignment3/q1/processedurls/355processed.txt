iDevices Sells iGrill and Kitchen Thermometers to Weber

   Wednesday February 10, 2016 1:00 PM PST by [80]Joe Rossignol
   iDevices has announced that its app-enabled iGrill and Kitchen
   Thermometer accessories have been acquired by [81]Weber-Stephen
   Products, a worldwide manufacturer of charcoal, gas, and electric
   outdoor grills and related accessories. The acquisition includes the
   iGrill2, iGrill mini, Kitchen Thermometer, and Kitchen Thermometer
   mini. The terms of the agreement are confidential.
   iGrill-Weber-iDevices
   Weber will partner with iDevices to release a new iGrill app, which is
   expected to be available in spring 2016. Until then, iGrill and Kitchen
   Thermometer users can continue using their accessories through the
   existing [82]iDevices Connected app. Unlike some of its other products,
   iDevices's iGrill and Kitchen Thermometer accessories are not
   compatible with Apple's [83]HomeKit smart home platform.
   iDevices said it will now be able to focus more on becoming a leader in
   the home automation market. The accessory maker already sells
   [84]multiple HomeKit-enabled products, including a Switch, Outdoor
   Switch, and Thermostat. It introduced [85]four more HomeKit accessories
   at CES 2016, including a Socket, Wall Switch, Dimmer Switch, and Wall
   Outlet. The products will be released throughout 2016.
   iGrill is an intelligent thermometer that allows you to monitor the
   temperature of the meat you are grilling on iPhone, iPad, or iPod
   touch.

   The inevitable march of technology continues, sometimes to my chagrin.
   This is one of those times. I am a self professed tech geek, but there
   are times where being disconnected is freeing. Grilling is one of those
   times for me. Flames, smoke, beer, and talking crap with my friends. No
   rings, buzzes, jingles or vibrations. Same with books. I love the smell
   of the paper and tactile feel of turning pages. Sigh.

   I got my dad an iGrill a couple years ago and he loves it. He always
   overcooks chicken and this device notifies you when it reaches the
   right temperature, and it comes out perfectly every time.

   If you're cooking something over a multi-hour period, being able to
   check your grill status remotely is invaluable... it allows you to
   actually get other stuff done without being tethered to the grill...

   This really isn't for grilling. It is for barbeque (smoking).
   Having the ability to go inside when grilling, which cooks the meat in
   a few minutes isn't useful.
   However, having the ability to go inside during a ten-hour smoke is
   extremely valuable.
   I really like Weber. Their company impresses me, and I'm guessing that
   they treat their employees well, because every time I speak with one,
   they are upbeat and happy.
   But, they are very far from a technology company. I really hope they
   keep all the employees involved in the products they bought, because
   they have little or no ability to keep them up to date over time, which
   is necessary for this type of equipment.

   I was just about to say, these are products that exist because they can
   and not because anyone wants them.
   I want them.

   My iGrill 2 gets used 3-5 times a week. And I don't even own a grill.
   It's my all purpose kitchen thermometer. Those $10-$20 thermometers
   from Bed Bath Beyond were retired once the iGrill showed up.
   It'll be interesting to see what happens to the price once (I assume)
   Weber rebrands it.

   Yup I'll pay double for a weber grill over a cheap knockoff anytime
   unfortunately, they've semi succumbed to the market and have the
   Chinese made spirit line now that's made in China. Genesis and summit
   grills are still usa made. I also have a kettle and a smokey mountain
   smoker which I would use the igrill on

   Plus the iGrill has two probes, which means you can control two
   different temperatures at the same time. I used it this Thanksgiving
   and had one probe in the breast and one in the thigh.
   It really comes in handy for barbecues too. You can monitor steak and
   chicken at once. And the notifications make it so that you can still
   socialize with people while the food is cooking.

   I love the way IOT devices are getting more and more common, but these
   seem like overkill to me. I'm sure someone out there would love to
   check a grill's temperature from a phone, but it's probably
   cost-prohibitive for most people.
   $99.95, cheaper than ruining some nice steaks.

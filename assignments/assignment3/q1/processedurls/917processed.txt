   Mike de Jong sat on information about an investigation into drug safety
   research for seven weeks as British Columbia health minister and left
   his successor to reveal what would become a damaging scandal, newly
   released [59]documents show.

   And the documents confirm that Margaret MacDiarmid, who took over the
   health ministry from de Jong, was told to announce the RCMP had been
   asked to investigate even though that had not happened.

   The documents shed more light on the bungled firing of drug safety
   researchers over allegations of contracting irregularities and
   inappropriate data access in the ministry's pharmaceutical services
   division (PSD).

   Eight people were eventually fired. Most have since been exonerated and
   rehired or paid financial compensation. One, Roderick MacIsaac, killed
   himself after he was fired. The scandal damaged drug safety research
   and has cost taxpayers millions.

   The documents, released under freedom-of-information, show a briefing
   note on the situation headlined "Internal Review and Investigation of
   PSD staff" was created for de Jong on July 16, 2012.

   The note suggests the government was preparing to go public or worried
   about a leak to the media. It included an eight-point list of
   recommended responses to questions. The note also said the Public
   Service Agency had a draft copy of a review done by labour ministry
   staff after a March 28, 2012, complaint to the Auditor General's office
   about irregularities in the drug safety research office.

   But the investigation remained a secret. The briefing note for de Jong
   was updated Aug. 27, 2012. The update had a more urgent tone and
   additional details, including the claim that the RCMP had been
   contacted and the line: "We are committed to being as open and
   transparent as possible."

   It provided more talking points for de Jong. "Government is currently
   reviewing a complaint in respect… (Censored in the FOI release) within
   the research and evidence development section of the Ministry of
   Health's pharmaceutical services division," it said. Data access and
   contracting privileges had been suspended for people involved in the
   division and senior ministry staff met with University of Victoria and
   University of British Columbia about the contracts.

   'Bigger and uglier than I understood': Health deputy

   Emails released under FOI show that behind the scenes health deputy
   minister Graham Whitmarsh was growing increasingly concerned about the
   issue.

   After reading a draft of the internal investigation report, Whitmarsh
   sounded an alarm to senior bureaucrats on Aug. 9, 2012. In a heavily
   censored email to four bureaucrats, including assistant deputy
   ministers Lindsay Kislock and Manjit Sidhu, Whitmarsh demanded answers.
   "When, to who and what was reported? Was anything done?"

   Whitmarsh was more emphatic in a later email. "I am going to arrange
   another meeting as I am concerned that this is bigger and uglier than I
   understood," he wrote.

   But things were changing in government. On Aug. 29, 2012, Kevin Falcon
   resigned as finance minister, citing family reasons.

   On Sept. 5, 2012, Premier Christy Clark shuffled her cabinet. De Jong
   was named finance minister and MacDiarmid took over health.

   The FOI release reveals that five days earlier MacDiarmid was already
   being prepared to deal with the scandal. The briefing note was updated
   for her on Aug. 31, 2012. The new version, headlined "Internal
   Investigation - MoH," included 15 recommended responses to questions
   about the scandal.

   MacDiarmid held a news conference the day after taking over as health
   minister, saying four people had been fired and three suspended. She
   didn't reveal names.

   She followed the directions in the briefing note and said the RCMP had
   been asked to investigate, "after we found evidence of inappropriate
   conduct, contracting and data-management practices." Internal RCMP
   documents released in 2015 say the province's team of internal
   investigators, led by Wendy Taylor, did not report the incident to the
   RCMP until Sept. 12, 2012. Two years later, the RCMP had not received
   any evidence from the province, so there was no investigation.

   Eight people were eventually fired: Ron Mattson, Malcolm Maclure,
   Rebecca and William Warburton, Robert Hart, Roderick MacIsaac, Ramsay
   Hamdi and David Scott.

   Hart and Maclure were reinstated. The Warburtons' settlement was
   announced in late 2015. Mattson settled a lawsuit in 2014. Hamdi and
   Scott filed union grievances. MacIsaac, a co-op student, died of
   suicide after his firing.

   MacIsaac's family asked the BC Liberal government for a public inquiry
   into the botched investigation. Instead, the government appointed
   Ombudsperson Jay Chalke last summer to conduct a probe behind closed
   doors.

   In a June 23, 2015 teleconference with reporters, de Jong said
   "ministers assume a political accountability" for what goes on in their
   ministry, but personnel investigations are done at arm’s length. He
   said that, after leaving the Health Ministry, he was disappointed a
   proper investigation didn't happen, but opposed the concept of an open,
   public inquiry.

   "We've been through a variety of processes and what is the question
   that is to be answered by an inquiry that generally speaking will
   involve the expenditure of millions upon millions of dollars?" de Jong
   said.

   Whitmarsh was among three deputy ministers fired without cause after
   the BC Liberals won the 2013 election. He was paid $461,000 in
   severance. [Tyee]

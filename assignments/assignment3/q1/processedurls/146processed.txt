Benefits of sharing

   A swift and effective response to emerging infectious diseases demands
   that researchers have ready access to the latest data on the pathogens
   responsible. There is still a long way to go to ensure this.

   Another year, another virus. As the Ebola-virus epidemic recedes, Zika
   dominates the news. The virus, which usually causes only mild symptoms,
   has been linked to a reported increase in the [35]number of babies born
   in Brazil with microcephaly — abnormally small heads and brains. The
   possible implications of this for pregnant women demand a rapid and
   evidence-based approach.

   The immediate priorities are to gather epidemiological and clinical
   data to establish whether the apparent spike in cases is real and, if
   so, [36]to what extent the Zika virus is involved. And researchers
   elsewhere must have full access to all of this information as soon as
   it is available.

   [37]The next steps on Zika

   Conventional scientific publishing, based on rounds of peer review, can
   be too slow to rapidly disseminate research findings during a
   public-health emergency. One solution is the immediate release of data
   to public databases and subsequent publication of peer-reviewed
   analysis. As we have said before, prior release of data and analysis to
   public databases, preprint servers and forums will not jeopardize
   consideration of a submission to Nature journals. And Nature journals
   will make all papers relating to Zika virus free to access until
   further notice.

   Already, there have been promising moves to make data on microcephaly,
   and on the epidemic of Zika in the Americas, readily accessible. The
   World Health Organization (WHO) has announced a ‘Zika Open’ initiative,
   in which all relevant submissions to its Bulletin will be posted online
   within 24 hours.

   In this issue, we publish research that demonstrates the need for rapid
   data sharing during outbreaks. As detailed in this issue,
   genome-sequencing technology has advanced to the point at which the
   whole genome of a virus sample can be sequenced in the field within
   24 hours by means of [38]a portable sequencing system. Previously, such
   sequencing during the course of an epidemic has been slower because it
   has relied on sending samples to a laboratory. Although this method
   still faces technical challenges, it should prove a crucial tool in
   epidemiological research. It offers the potential to rapidly trace how
   a disease is being passed from person to person, and so help to guide
   authorities to direct resources that can break these transmission
   chains.

   [39]Data sharing: Make outbreak research open access

   But the full potential of this advance can be realized only if
   scientists can access sequence data obtained from samples taken at
   different times and places during an outbreak. Pathogen genome
   sequences are most useful when studied alongside epidemiological and
   clinical data.

   Many scientists across the research fields, but notably in genomics,
   have been enthusiastic champions of early data release.
   Infectious-disease researchers make use of public forums and databases
   such as virological.org and GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All
   Influenza Data). The former resource is becoming a major platform for
   sharing and discussing preliminary analyses of data and it already
   hosts a genomic analysis of the Zika virus. And, launched just over
   four years ago, ISARIC (International Severe Acute Respiratory and
   Emerging Infection Consortium) works with clinicians and
   epidemiologists to put in place pre-agreed protocols and data-sharing
   processes that can then quickly be adapted to a new situation.

   Almost one year ago, this journal published a Comment article that
   called for [40]the immediate sharing of outbreak data, a policy that
   the authors themselves had adopted during their early sequencing of
   Ebola-virus genomes in the 2014–15 outbreak. They also called on the
   WHO to convene a meeting to develop guidance for data sharing during
   infectious-disease outbreaks. Such a meeting took place last September.
   It was attended by government representatives, public-health agencies,
   scientists, research funders, ethicists and publishers. All
   acknowledged that pathogen sequence information collected during a
   public-health emergency is of greatest value when released openly, in
   as close to real time as possible.

   [41]Ebola teaches tough lessons about rapid research

   A statement released by the WHO after the meeting emphasized the
   “fundamental moral obligation” of every researcher who generates
   information related to a public-health emergency to share their
   preliminary results once these have undergone quality control.
   Representatives from leading biomedical journals also unequivocally
   emphasized that disclosure of such information would not prejudice
   journal publication.

   Scientists still face challenges to swift data sharing. For example, as
   was seen during the emergence of the H5N1 and H7N9 avian influenza
   viruses and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, rapid data
   sharing can be hampered by a lack of international rules that govern
   how credit and rights (including intellectual property) should be
   fairly distributed among scientists and authorities in the countries
   where outbreaks occur as well as researchers based elsewhere.

   To play our part in driving the shift towards fast data sharing during
   public-health emergencies, Nature journals will now encourage authors
   who haven’t already deposited their relevant sequence information in
   public archives to do so on submission.

Let's relax all year round

   BY Mick Sharkie @TheSharkTweet

   One take on relaxed attire. Pic: WILLIAM WEST/AFP/Getty Images

   ON Thursday, Racing Victoria launches its Relaxed Racing initiative at
   Caulfield.

   The Relaxed Racing homepage tells us this is the “breezy little sister
   of the Spring Racing Carnival”, running from February through March. A
   time to hit the track with the family and enjoy the casual vibe, maybe
   a picnic, some tunes and, if you’re lucky, a winner or two.

   Brilliant.

   But what I want to know is this - why can’t we relax at the races all
   year round and why can’t racing shake off its stuffy, outdated dress
   codes for the rest of the year?

   Everything that Relaxed Racing promotes is what we should be spruiking
   to potential patrons every week of the year, not just as a summertime
   gimmick.

   We keep hearing from racing administrators that the sport needs to
   evolve with the needs of modern audiences, so why continue to push
   stodgy dress codes for the majority of the year in an era when the
   average office worker doesn’t even wear a suit to work?

   I applaud Racing Victoria for continuing with the initiative and I
   point to the three city clubs (MRC, MVRC, VRC) for offering relaxed
   members' dress codes during summer (jackets and ties optional at MRC &
   MVRC, jackets optional but ties required at VRC). But surely we’ve
   reached a point as a society in 2016 that we do not require patrons of
   a sporting event to dress as if they’re attending a funeral.

   But Shark, I hear you say, if you don’t want to wear a suit and tie
   just go to the public areas.

   Great! That means there will be five people on the public lawn instead
   of four!

   Standing on an abandoned concrete carpark is not my idea of a good time
   or what I pay my club membership fees for. I, and many like me, want to
   enjoy the members' facilities we pay for as well a recreational day at
   the track in comfortable clobber.

   I don’t want to be treated like a second class citizen and turned away
   at the barriers because I’m not wearing a suit and tie.

   Look at the picnic racing model and the explosion of attendance at
   rural and seaside tracks around Victoria; I can tell you that the
   crowds aren’t there to spot the next Black Caviar, rather they enjoy a
   day at the races with friends and family without the fuss and bother of
   getting dressed to the nines.

   Racing continues to struggle in its attempts to attract and maintain
   new fans and continues to preach to an ageing audience. Sports betting
   continues to siphon current and potential racing punters away from the
   sport in droves. Off-season race track crowds, in public or members'
   areas, are reminiscent of the daytime scenes in the post-apocalyptic
   flick I Am Legend.

   The requirement for suits and ties outside of the designated Relaxed
   Racing timeslot, is not helping racing fight back.

   So tomorrow, the head honchos will tell us that it’s time to relax, but
   come the end of March it’s back to the nonsensical and archaic practice
   of suiting up for a leisure pursuit each weekend.

   Let’s give racing a makeover. Sharkie says: Relax...all year round.

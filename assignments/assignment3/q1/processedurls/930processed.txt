Syrian Kurds open diplomatic mission in Moscow

First Syrian Kurdish overseas mission aims to secure support for autonomy as
Russia seeks to demonstrate it has allies other than Bashar al-Assad

   By [47]Roland Oliphant, Moscow

   5:34PM GMT 10 Feb 2016

   Syrian Kurdish separatists opened a mission in Moscow on Wednesday, in
   a bid to secure Kremlin backing for an autonomous Kurdish region in any
   post-war settlement in [48]Syria.

   The representative office in an industrial district of eastern Moscow
   is the first of several foreign missions the Rojava Self Ruled
   Administration, the self-proclaimed government of Kurdish-held northern
   Syria, plans to establish in Europe.

   “This is a historic moment for the Kurdish people politically and
   diplomatically,” said Sinam Mohamad, the European Representative of the
   Rojava Self-Ruled Democratic Administration, the de-facto government
   running Kurdish-held northern Syria. “For too long we have been unable
   to represent our interests on the world stage. This will allow us to
   have a voice abroad.”

   Two other offices, in Berlin and Paris, are due to open in the coming
   months, she said.

   The Moscow representative office is not formally recognised as a
   diplomatic mission by the Russian foreign ministry, and will officially
   operate as an NGO in order to conform with Russian law. The foreign
   ministry has said Kurdish interests should be represented in Russia by
   the official Syrian diplomatic mission.

   However, the Kremlin’s decision to allow it to open at all will further
   stoke tensions with Turkey. Moscow’s relationship with Ankara was
   plunged into crisis following the shoot down of a Russian warplane on
   the Syrian Turkish border in November.

   [50]The new office is closely tied to the Syrian Kurdish Democratic
   Union Party (PYD), which exercises de-facto control over a large swathe
   of northern Syria and wants to maintain that autonomy within whatever
   post-war settlement emerges at the end of the civil war.

   [51]Turkey, which considers the PYD a branch of the outlawed Kurdistan
   Workers’ Party (PKK), vetoed Kurdish participation in peace talks in
   Geneva earlier this month. The PKK is officially proscribed as a
   terrorist group in the United States and Britain.

   The party’s military wing, the YPG, has cooperated with both the U.S.
   led coalition against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil)
   and the Russian airforce’s campaign in support of Bashar Assad.

   Recently Kurdish forces have taken advantage of [52]Russian airstrikes
   to advance against non-Isil rebels north of Aleppo, a rebel stronghold
   city currently facing encirclement by Syrian government forces.

   “Although there is no formal alliance or agreement, there is de-facto
   military cooperation with the Russians,” one Kurdish official at the
   ceremony said.

   He declined to give details of that cooperation, and said he could not
   confirm or deny reports that the YPG has received deliveries of Russian
   weapons.

   While it is unclear how far Russia is willing to back the Kurdish goal
   of independence, or at minimum autonomous status within Syria,
   delegates at Tuesday’s ceremony said they were grateful for tacit
   Kremlin support thus far.

   “Simply accepting us opening this office is already a form of support,”
   said Ms Mohamed, who said the stated goal was for an autonomous region
   within Syria rather than full independence. She said she hoped PYD
   delegates may attend peace talks in Geneva on February 25.

   While Russia has refrained from publicly endorsing Kurdish ambitions,
   the foreign ministry on Wednesday called for Syrian Kurds to be
   included in the Geneva peace talks.

   “We’ve said many times that for a full political process it is
   necessary to involve all non-terrorist forces and groups that are one
   way or another involved in the dramatic events in Syria,’ said Maria
   Zakharova, the foreign ministry’s official spokesman. “Ignoring forces
   like the Kurds is simply a road to nowhere,” she said.

   Russia has a small but active Kurdish diaspora community, and the
   Soviet Union actively backed the PKK against Turkey during the Cold
   War.

   Russian foreign policy experts said the move reflected a crisis in
   Russia’s relations with Turkey and a desire on the part of Moscow to
   demonstrate that its interests in Syria and the Middle East extend well
   beyond support for Bashar Assad.

   “For the Kurds, on the other hand, it allows them to show that they are
   an independent force and can cooperate with anyone they like - the
   Americans can’t just tell them what to do,” said Fyodor Lukyanov, the
   editor of Russian in Foreign Affairs, a journal.

   “Everyone sees the Kurds as potential allies, and they’re playing this
   game quite well. That’s why the Turks are so nervous - what becomes of
   Kurdish territory is an absolutely key part of what a future Syria
   looks like,” he added. .

   While Russian diplomats were not present at Tuesday’s opening ceremony
   or subsequent celebratory banquet, several prominent and controversial
   Russian public figures were.

   [53]Alexander Borodai, the former leader of the Russian-backed
   separatist Donetsk People’s Republic in Ukraine, said he attended
   because he respected the Kurds’ struggle for autonomy and considered
   them “allies in a struggle against a common world enemy.”

   He said he did not believe reports that former pro-Russian separatist
   fighters from east Ukraine had gone to fight in Syria, and said there
   was no formal cooperation between east Ukrainian separatists and the
   Syrian Kurds. “This is the first time we’ve been in contact,” he said.

Scottish house prices 'still rising'

     * 11 February 2016

   Scottish house prices continued to rise last month despite flatter
   demand for property, according to a report.

   A survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) found a
   lack of supply was driving prices up.

   Surveyors also indicated that they expect sales to increase over the
   next three months.

   Rics said this was due in part to buy-to-let investors moving to
   purchase property ahead of [60]proposed changes to the Land and
   Buildings Transaction Tax.

   From April, people buying second homes and buy-to-let landlords face an
   additional supplement of 3% of the purchase price.

'Supply lagging'

   Rics in Scotland director Sarah Speirs said: "Again we are seeing a
   failure of pick-up in new properties coming onto the Scottish market
   and, although demand was not as strong this month, housing supply is
   still lagging behind.

   "However, with buy-to-let investors rushing to get into the market
   ahead of the land and buildings transaction tax hike, the near-term
   pressure on prices is intensifying.

   "How the tax changes planned for the buy-to-let sector over the next
   few years play out remains to be seen, but there are concerns raised in
   the survey that some existing landlords will look to either gradually
   scale back on their portfolios or exit the market altogether as the
   more penal regime begins to bite.

   "Against this backdrop, it is perhaps not surprising that the key Rics
   indicators points to further rent (as well as house price) increases."

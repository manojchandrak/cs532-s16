   Barbara A. Res is a former Trump vice president who says she oversaw
   construction of his crown jewel on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue - Trump
   Tower.
   "He told me he thought I was a killer. He said, 'Men are better than
   women, but a good woman is better than 10 men,''' she said.
   Trump was the first person to arrive at his business and would often
   answer the phone until his staff arrived, she said.
   On the campaign trail, the billionaire says he would be great for
   women, and often brings up Bill Clinton's past sex scandals.
   “I don't think Bill Clinton is sexist, but definitely a womanizer. I
   would say Donald falls into that category,” Res said.

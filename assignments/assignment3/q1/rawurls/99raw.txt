MS has been captain for such a long time and he is used to it. We all get used to it. At the same time, when we do well, we are taken up to mountains and the skies.&quot; 
&quot;MS has this fantastic ability to remain calm under any situation. Lot of people have asked me: 'You have been with him, how does he remain calm?' I tell them that he doesn't show it. From inside he is different, from outside he is different. That goes around in the dressing-room and he gets a lot of respect. We only look at the criticism but the amount of respect he gets in India is unbelievable,&quot; Ganguly said. (World Cup triumph most important moment of my career: Tendulkar )
Questioned if he is ready to coach the Indian cricket team at the moment, Ganguly said that his administrative responsibilities will not allow him to take up the job at the moment even if he is offered. (Kohli, Rohit genuine superstars: Pietersen )
&quot;I really don't know as I have got another job to do at the moment. I am actually running the cricket (as CAB president). You can't do both at the same time. You have to see where life goes. 
&quot;At the present moment, 'No' (to coaching) as I am an administrator with responsibilities of running the game,&quot; the 'Prince of Kolkata' said.
On his role in the high-profile Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) that is supposed to pick the next coach, Ganguly said: &quot;To be honest, I don't know whether that committee exists at all. I think team is doing well and may be we will have to think about it in future.&quot;

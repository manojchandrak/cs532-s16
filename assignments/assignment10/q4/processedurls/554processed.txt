What’s up with this Chinese box office record-shattering comedy ‘The
Mermaid’?

   Slapstick merfolk sold tons of tickets on the Lunar New Year's Day
   By [56]Emily Rome [57] @EmilyNRome | Wednesday, Feb 10, 2016 7:03 PM
   [58]- comments

   China kicked off the Year of the Monkey by breaking box office records.
   The country’s movie theaters pulled in $100.5 million (660 million
   yuan) on Lunar New Year’s Day — a single day record. A comedy about
   mermaids is largely to thank for the big turnout at the movies on
   Monday.

   A massive $40.9 million of that total came from this comedy, simply
   titled [59]The Mermaid, on the film’s opening day.

   So why is mermaid craze sweeping across China? Here’s what we know
   about the hit new movie:

   What’s the story?
   The Mermaid tells the tale of a mermaid who falls for the evil business
   tycoon she’s been sent to seduce and assassinate.

   Who’s the big name in this?
   The name selling a lot of tickets here is director Stephen Chow, a Hong
   Kong-born actor/director/screenwriter who’s known in China for such
   hits as Kung Fu Hustle and Shaolin Soccer.

   descriptor

   What are critics saying?
   Variety’s chief Asia film critic had praise for the movie, [60]calling
   it “pure enchantment” with “scenes of side-splitting slapstick” though
   the screenplay is “not wildly original.” A reviewer for daily Chinese
   publication Global Times wasn’t so thrilled with The Mermaid,
   [61]declaring the film a “disappointing” film that uses old tropes and
   labeling it “a class on environmental protection masquerading as a
   romance story.” Chinese website Mtime.com (kind of a Rotten Tomatoes +
   IMDb + Fandango) has The Mermaid scored at 7.9 out of 10.

   What’s this about it being an environmental protection film?
   The Mermaid’s evil business tycoon is using sonar technology to get rid
   of sea life in a wildlife reserve he’s somehow managed to purchase. The
   sonar’s causing the merfolk to die or get sick. Apparently, it all ends
   up being a story that’s meant to resonate Chinese viewers who know
   their country is dealing with a host of environmental crises.

   Who’s the audience for this?
   Unclear. As the Global Times writer states, “A film showing during the
   Spring Festival holiday, it is practically implied to be a film
   targeted for family audiences. However, some of the violent and sexual
   themes in the film are rather improper for young audiences, and yet no
   notice of this was given during earlier marketing of the film.”

   Will it screen in the U.S.?
   Looks like it will! And very soon too. Both [62]AMC Theatres’ website
   and [63]China Film Insider list February 19 for the American release
   date.

   Alright, so can I see a trailer for this thing?
   Yup, here you go, a preview for The Mermaid, complete with silly
   drawings of half-fish, half-woman creatures sketched by guys who have
   no idea what a mermaid looks like:

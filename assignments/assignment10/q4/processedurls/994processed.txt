   Two sheriff's deputies have died after a gunman opened fire inside a
   crowded Panera restaurant in Maryland.

   David Brian Evans, 67, first fatally shot a sheriff's deputy in the
   head inside the restaurant in Abingdon at lunchtime on Wednesday, then
   killed the other deputy in a shootout later, authorities said.

   The suspect was also killed in the exchange of gunfire not far from the
   Boulevard at Box Hill, the shopping center where the restaurant was
   located, Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler said.

   Remarkably, no bystanders were hurt.

   Police have not released a motive for the shooting, but the sheriff
   said he believed the first deputy who approached the gunman was shot
   'because he was wearing a uniform.'

   Evans had warrants out for his arrest in Harford County and Florida,
   where he was accused of assaulting a police officer and fleeing and
   eluding.

   Gahler said a loaded handgun was recovered from him.

   The slain officers were described as a 30-year veteran and the other a
   16-year veteran. The sheriff said he had met with both of their
   families but was withholding their names because more relatives needed
   to be notified.

   'This is a tragic day for the Harford County Sheriff's Office,' Gahler
   said, his eyes moist with tears.

   'They were two outstanding deputies who served the citizens of this
   community faithfully.'

   A 15-year-old girl, who witnessed the initial shooting inside the
   sandwich shop, said she had been in a booth with her mother just 10
   feet away when the terror unfolded.

   Sophia Faulkner said she almost sat right next to the gunman – but
   instead, she and her mother chose a booth a little further away because
   the man appeared 'sketchy' and disheveled.

   He was sitting in the back and hadn't ordered any food, she said.

   A sheriff's deputy arrived at the restaurant at around 11.45am to check
   on a report about the man causing a problem.

   The deputy tried to talk to the man, who was apparently known to
   workers there. The deputy sat down beside him, asked how he was doing
   and the man shot him in the head.

   'I saw him fall back out of his chair and the blood started coming
   out,' Faulkner said.

   'I didn't know how to process it. My mom said, 'What's going on?' and I
   said, 'Get down, someone just got shot.'

   She said 'everyone started screaming' after the gunshot and children -
   out of school because of snowfall - were running around.

   'I was freaking out so much and everybody was running to one side of
   the store. Families were huddling together. I didn't really know what
   was going on,' she said.

   'You see this stuff online and in movies and on TV when it happens, but
   you never think you're going to go out to lunch one day with your mom
   and it's just going to happen.'

   Her mother, Lynn Faulkner, a registered nurse, said that she recognized
   the man and believed he was mentally ill and in need of social
   services.
   It's unclear why the shooter choose to open fire. Police had been
   called to the restaurant about the man's behavior

   'I've seen him there frequently, and I've seen him at areas of the
   library,' she said. 'He's definitely in need of mental health care, and
   he never should have had a gun.'

   'He knew what he was doing, because he shot right for the head,' she
   continued.

   'Apparently, the policeman tried to come up to him, 'Hi, how are you
   doing,' - he's living in this store - and, 'Can you try to move on?' or
   'Why are you here today?' and that's when he immediately pulled out the
   gun and shot him.'

   The gunman fled and witnesses gave officers a description of him and
   told them which way he was headed, the sheriff said.

   After at least one deputy caught up with him, shots were exchanged. The
   deputy was left severely wounded and the suspect dead, the sheriff
   said. The deputy later died in hospital.

   'I saw two women and a child run from Panera to our back door. They
   were hysterical. They said they heard gunshots,' said bartender Mike
   Davis, who was working at the Ocean City Brewing Co.'s Taphouse.

   'We locked the door and went to talk to a cop. The cop said not to let
   anyone in. Then, we heard more gunshots, 'Pop, pop, pop, pop,' from
   down in the shopping center. It was hectic.'

   The sheriff said investigators believe the person acted alone.

   'The restaurant was very full at lunchtime,' Gahler said. 'Thankfully,
   no one else was injured.'

   One of the deputies was treated at the University of Maryland R Adams
   Cowley Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore.

   Video showed an ambulance and a sheriff's car escorted by police on
   motorcycles leaving, apparently taking the body to the nearby state
   medical examiner's office. Police lined each side of the street and
   saluted when the vehicles drove by.

   Yellow tape blocked off the Panera and Taphouse restaurants, but people
   were coming and going freely at other businesses after the shooting.

   Panera spokeswoman Amanda Cardosi said the company is heartbroken.

   'Our thoughts and actions now are directed towards the victims and
   their families,' she said.

   'This location will remain closed as we work with law enforcement to
   investigate,' she said.

   Maryland Governor Larry Hogan has ordered flags be flown at half-staff
   to honor the two deputies.

   In a statement, Hogan said: 'Anytime law enforcement or first
   responders lose their lives in the line of duty, it is a tragedy and
   today’s violence in Abingdon and the deaths of two Harford County
   sheriff’s deputies is nothing less than absolutely heartbreaking.

   'The First Lady and I send our most sincere thoughts and prayers to the
   families and loved ones of the brave deputies who made the ultimate
   sacrifice today for the community they selflessly served.

   'It is my hope that their commitment and dedication to law enforcement
   and protecting others will be remembered and will forever serve as an
   inspiration to others.'

   A spokesman for Hogan said the order takes effect Thursday, and will
   remain in effect until after funeral services are held for the
   deputies.

   Harford County Executive Barry Glassman ordered the county flag to be
   flown at half-staff effective immediately.

   SINGAPORE: Concert promoter Midas Promotions has sued LAMC Productions
   for allegedly reneging on an agreement on a joint venture to bring
   comedian Russell Peters to Singapore in 2012.

   The company claimed it was entitled to 50 per cent of the profits from
   the two sold-out shows, adding up to an estimated S$500,000 or more.

   LAMC Productions, however, contended that there was no joint venture to
   speak of since Peters agreed to stage his Notorious World Tour at the
   Singapore Indoor Stadium on May 5 and 6, 2012, on a percentage deal,
   instead of a flat fee as the two promoters had agreed on.

   In the hearing that started on Wednesday (Feb 10), the court heard that
   Midas Promotions’ founder and managing director Michael Hosking
   approached LAMC Productions around March 15, 2012, with a proposal to
   co-promote Mr Peters’ show.

   Over a phone conversation with LAMC Productions’ co-owner and
   co-director James Ross Knudson, Mr Hosking said both agreed to each
   submit a flat fee of US$200,000 (S$278,000) separately to Mr Peters’
   agent, and that whichever party got the show would split the cost and
   profits on a 50-50 basis.

   The co-owner and co-director of LAMC Productions, Ms Lauretta Alabons,
   who took the witness stand on Wednesday, said she reluctantly went
   along with this agreement to “save face for her husband (Mr Knudson)”
   even though she was already in talks with Mr Peters’ agent since
   December 2011.

   Mr Peters’ agent eventually rejected the offers from both companies,
   insisting on a percentage deal instead.

   Ms Alabons claimed it was clear that Mr Peters’ agent would only agree
   on a percentage deal and did not want to work with Midas Promotions.

   Since there was no discussion for Midas Promotions and LAMC Productions
   to work together based on a percentage deal, as it “would not have made
   financial sense”, there was no joint venture to speak of, said Ms
   Alabons. In her affidavit, she said a second show date on May 6, 2012,
   was only added around April 11, 2012, as the show for May 5, 2012, sold
   out in early April.

   A second show “was not contemplated” at the time when Mr Hosking first
   approached LAMC Productions, she said.

   Mr Hosking claimed that LAMC Productions “would have made about
   S$500,000 or more in terms of profits from the show based on our
   estimate of the overheads and costs, and our knowledge of the fact that
   both shows were sold out at a venue where the capacity was set up for
   in excess of 10,000 per night”.

   Ms Alabons, however, revealed that LAMC Productions’ net revenue from
   the show on May 5, 2012, was S$122,137.74.

   Midas Promotions and LAMC Productions previously worked together to
   bring musical acts Placebo and Justin Bieber to Singapore in March 2010
   and April 2011, respectively.

   The hearing for the case continues.

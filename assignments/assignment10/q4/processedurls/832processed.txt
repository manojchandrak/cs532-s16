   I pressed agree on the first part, but part about the division
   graphics, I think it's easily one of the if not best current gen in
   terms of graphics, especially when you do take note of all the visuals
   and what the engine has allowed them to create..

   It's certainly an impressive looking game, I'm in now way trying to say
   it looks bad. I just feel there are better looking games already this
   gen. Though I do give huge kudos for how good it looks in such a big
   environment. They have done a great job from what I've seen from the
   beta.

   If people are comparing graphics then you have to compare like games,
   saying there have been better graphic games this gen and basing the
   comparison off linear single player games is not fair. This game is a
   medium scale mmo and for that the graphics are awesome.

   Considering it's a 1:1 scale replica of that section of New York, I'm
   happy with the graphics. Plus 'poor graphics' isn't something that will
   prevent me from playing something.
   I can't understand why some people only want something to look good,
   rather than play good. If something only looks good, you get a photo or
   a movie. If something only plays well you've still got a game.

   Looked and played fine by console standards. It isn't a high end PC so
   you have to give it some wiggle room (not 1080/60 both with Ultra
   textures and blah, blah, blah).
   It is one of the better looking console games actually and is
   multiplayer on top of that. There are a few flatter places of course
   and true physics is limited to manage it all (cars for example won't
   blow up in a spray of mechanical glory) but I'm fine with that as I had
   fun and it never distracted me from gameplay.

   I couldn't change to my pistol - no matter how quickly or how long I
   held down the button - just kept swapping between the two other

   That was really the only downside I experienced - only played for about

   and it looks fantastic.
   I preordered it on PlayStation 4 in just never got the time to play the
   closed beta too much work lol.
   I'll try to have time for the open beta the check it out, but just for
   the Xbox one footage looks amazing I'm loving all of the weather

   People are dillusional or just trying to pump this game up. The beta on
   consoles was atrocious. In fact it was so bad I called don't and got a
   refund. The player health and ability to take so many shots was
   ridiculous. all of my friends experienced the same. Invisible, heavy
   lag, the players not dying . They should implement a hardcore mode.

   @ocelot07 just dont act like it was some perfect game. Like if you
   didn't experience any issues. The "fun" was there it was just eclipsed
   by its issues. It doesn't have to be a simulator, i know how you core
   noobs like to be able to take a billion shells , I'm just saying if
   that want to appeal to another fan base they should have a mode where
   it's friendlier to the "lone wolfs" so you can stand a chance against a
   squad trying to mob you. because let's face in the dark zone if you are
   alone you are not surviving, with the way people take damage. You need
   a group with you.

   Although not listed in the article I hope there's an option to remap
   controls to personal tastes (at least on console(s)). I don't like how
   Rainbow Six doesn't have this option. I know some people will argue
   "controls are fine!" however I feel some of the buttons were mapped the
   way they were last minute.

   Not sure if you're a ps4 or xb player but ps4 does have that feature
   for all games. That's assuming the feature is available for betas, I'm
   not sure on that one.

   I did notice the feature and it is nice, however there's no way to save
   the options as separate setups for different games. I wouldn't have
   mind as much however to reset the controls each game gets annoying over
   time. If there is a way to save for various games though I'd appreciate
   it. Even if it was a save for up to 2-3 games I'd be fine with it and
   just switch as needed.
   Otherwise I see it as a plan B and will use it as needed.

   I still don't get the point of the DZ if you lose everything if you
   die. I know you don't lose allllll of your XP and currency at once, but
   if you keep dying, what's left? I would assume you'd have to be really
   bad to continuously die in there, but it just seems odd to me. I'd
   think you'd get to keep your DZ XP at least.

   Because it's what makes the game interesting, everything else about
   this game is poor. The DZ is the best part of the game because it's got
   risk reward system at play which makes player interaction interesting
   and different compared to most games on consoles. Forces people to play
   differently and doesn't spoon feed you like most games, you have to
   actually learn the game to succeed.

   We turned off Ambient Occlusion and put sharpness up to 70 in the game
   and the blur went away and the game actually looked really good as in
   crisp and clear. Objects in the distance looked clearer to. It depends
   on what you like but to us here it looked much better.. With it turned

   it plays like an mmo in terms of online/offline and servers and such.
   so u can go solo if you want and play in pve only zones so u wont have
   to deal with other players fighting you. its still an always online
   game

   Good list of changes here, sounds like they really did their homework
   on the problems during closed beta.

   Question - Is this game like 'DayZ?' I get the feeling it may be.

   Each mission does has a hard mode - if that is what you mean?
   You can also do the mission on hard straight away - not unlocking
   required.
   Each mission is also scalable to your level as well. Its not like
   destiny where when you become lv40 and if you do a strike its lv12. The
   missions enemies will be whatever level you are.

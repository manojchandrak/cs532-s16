NZ v Australia first Test: Aussies leave out James Pattinson as Jackson Bird

David Warner: "The ball will swing a lot" in First Test at Wellington0:48

   Cricket: Australian batsman David Warner is wary of the swinging ball
   ahead of the First Test against New Zealand in Wellington, but says he
   and his teammates won't have any issue re-adjusting to the red ball.

   JAMES Pattinson has been axed from the Australian XI due to a lack of
   fitness, meaning Jackson Bird will play his first Test match in nearly
   three years against New Zealand on Friday in Wellington.

   It’s a major blow to the Australian attack in the sense that the
   explosive pace of Pattinson was the major x-factor Steve Smith was
   going to have at his disposal.

   Smith declared the wicket one of the greenest he’d seen and New Zealand
   counterpart Brendon McCullum stated Wellington was certainly a bowl
   first pitch – making the toss potentially crucial.

   Pattinson has seriously battled with the shin injury he picked up at
   the end of the Australian summer and selectors decided he couldn’t be
   trusted to get through five days of a crucial Test match where the No.1
   ranking will be up for grabs for Smith’s side.

   The young firebrand was pulled out of his last-start Shield game for
   Victoria after just two days, however, despite his lack of fitness, he
   won’t be sent home with selectors confident they might be able to get
   him up for the second Test in Christchurch.

   Bird has a solid Test average of 23.30 to his name from three matches,
   and was man-of-the-match against Sri Lanka at the SCG back in early
   2013.

   es] Jackson Bird will certainly benefit from the more seam-friendly
   conditions.

   The 29-year-old has not had a look in since an unsuccessful cameo in
   the Ashes tour of that same year, but Smith said the Tasmanian would be
   an effective weapon alongside Josh Hazlewood and Peter Siddle.

   “The selectors aren’t 100 per cent sure whether (Pattinson) would get
   through this first Test match so that decision was made,” said Smith.

   “I think Jackson Bird has been bowling extremely well. I saw him for
   the first time yesterday in the nets and I thought he bowled extremely
   well. I’m really happy with the XI we’ve picked and hopefully we can
   have a successful week.

   “He’s still quite young and I think he’s been a quality bowler. He’s
   always performed really well at Shield level and I think it’s great
   that he gets another opportunity.

   “I saw him bowl yesterday and I think he’s bowling with quite good
   pace. He’s hitting a good area and he’s swinging the ball and swinging
   it late which is a great attribute to have and if he gets the ball in
   the right areas in this Test match I think he can do a bit of damage.

   “He runs in all day, he’s quite tall so he hits the bat a bit higher
   than what you think and he generally hits good areas.

   “I think that’s really important for us in this Test series
   particularly if the wickets are going to do a little bit. If we’re
   hitting good areas we’re going to create a lot of chances and I think
   he can do that for us.”
   [index&domain=heraldsun.com.au&td_widget=otherstories&widget=otherstori
   es] Fitness concerns have ruled out James Pattinson.

   Australia have stuck with the same top seven that swept West Indies at
   the SCG in early January, with Nathan Lyon as the spinner.

   New Zealand have elected to go with veteran Doug Bracewell over the
   in-form Matt Henry in their bowling attack, while Corey Anderson and
   debutant Henry Nicholls will form a new-look middle-order to the one
   the Black Caps brought to Australia.

   Australia: Joe Burns, David Warner, Usman Khawaja, Steve Smith (capt),
   Adam Voges, Mitch Marsh, Peter Nevill, Peter Siddle, Josh Hazlewood,
   Nathan Lyon, Jackson Bird.

   New Zealand: Martin Guptill, Tom Latham, Kane Williamson, Henry
   Nicholls, Brendon McCullum (capt), Corey Anderson, BJ Watling, Mark
   Craig, Doug Bracewell, Tim Southee, Trent Boult

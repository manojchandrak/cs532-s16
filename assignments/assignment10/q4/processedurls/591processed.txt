Elon Musk hasn't decided how much of the Model 3 to show next month

   On its fourth quarter earnings call this afternoon, discussion
   inevitably turned to the upcoming Model 3 during the Q&A session with
   analysts. In response to a question about what we'll see of the
   car [249]at its March 31st unveiling, CEO Elon Musk's reply was that he
   hasn't decided. Seriously: "We're trying to decide whether we should
   show all the cards or keep a few cards close to the vest," he said. "We
   haven't made a decision yet."

   It's unclear exactly how wide of a spectrum of options Musk is
   considering, though. Previous rumors that a second model, the
   mass-market Model Y crossover, could be shown in addition to the Model
   3 sedan [250]were shot down by Tesla — so we're almost certainly
   looking at a single vehicle for the time being. But whether we get just
   a few teaser shots or a full-on unveil of the actual car, inside and
   out, is apparently still a decision that rests in Musk's hands.

   Regardless of what we see, we're in for a bit of a wait: Tesla also
   reaffirmed its late 2017 target for initial production and delivery of
   the car, which means we'll be more than a year out.

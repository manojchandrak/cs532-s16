   A nurse charged with sexually assaulting a patient while he was working
   at the Bowie Health Center will go on trial Thursday in Upper Marlboro.

   Jared Nathan Kline of Springfield, [6]Virginia, faces charges of
   second-degree assault and fourth-degree sex offense following an
   incident in January 2014.

   A woman told police she came into the emergency room at the Bowie
   Health Center feeling ill; Kline was the nurse attending to her, the
   Prince George's County States Attorney's Office said in a statement
   released Wednesday.

   Kline entered the hospital room to draw blood from the victim and while
   checking her outstretched arm for a vein, Klineallegedly placed his
   groin into the victim's open hand, prosecutors said in describing the
   charges. Kline then left the room and returned to administer the IV and
   medicine and while administering the IV, he allegedly placed his
   genitals in the woman's hand.

   Immediately after the incident, the victim notified the doctor and
   police responded.

   Kline, who pleaded not guilty to the charges, also worked at several
   Washington, D.C. hospitals, including George Washington University. He
   has been accused of sexual abuse at least two other times in the
   District of Columbia.

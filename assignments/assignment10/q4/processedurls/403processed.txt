   A new political action committee plans to give the many women who have
   been victimized by Bill and Hillary Clinton a platform to tell their
   stories.

   [47]Rape Accountability Project for Education PAC, also known as RAPE
   PAC, plans to put victims in both television and radio ads that will
   shed light on how the Clintons worked to silence and destroy women that
   accused the former president of rape.

   “The plan is to feature the victims of Bill and Hillary in TV and radio
   ads and let them tell their own story,” said Roger Stone, the veteran
   Republican strategist who started the group.

   Stone says that the project will be known as Women v. Hillary and that
   it will resemble “an all woman Swift Boat operation,” a reference to
   the group of military veterans that worked to spread the truth about
   Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry’s time in Vietnam.

   Kathleen Willey, who says that Bill Clinton forced her to touch his
   genitals in the Oval Office, has signed on to be a spokesperson for
   RAPE PAC.

   Willey has [48]said that she thinks Hillary Clinton should be forced to
   answer questions on her husband’s long history of sexual assault and
   also that most of his misdeeds are still unknown.

   “When I was writing my book, I had women call me and tell me about
   their experiences at the hands of Bill Clinton,” Willey told the
   Washington Free Beacon last month. “And I was horrified by some of the
   things they were saying. But I don’t think they’ll ever talk fully. And
   you know what? I can’t say that I blame them. I mean, look what has
   happened to me.”

   “This is 2016, okay? This isn’t 1966,” Willey said. “And women are
   still dealing with the same thing. Blame the victim.”

   Stone says that his book, [49]The Clintons’ War on Women, “served as
   the catalyst” for RAPE PAC. The book was billed by Stone as a tell-all
   of the “decades-long campaign of sexual assault, intimidation, and
   cover-ups” led by Bill and Hillary Clinton.

   Stone has made it his mission this campaign to spoil Hillary Clinton’s
   attempt to run for president as “an advocate of women and girls.”

   “Hillary Clinton is an advocate for women as long as you are not one of
   Bill Clinton’s rape victims,” wrote Stone.

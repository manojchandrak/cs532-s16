Red Bull’s sneaky tactic at season launch

Red Bull release 2016 livery3:58

   V8: Red Bull releases their 2016 V8 Supercars livery and induct Shane
   van Gisbergen into their team - in a typically Red Bull way
     * February 2nd 2016
     * 3 months ago
     * /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/Motor Sport/V8/

   [player]

   RED Bull will stage their 2016 launch in London on Wednesday next week,
   but what can we expect to see from the event?

   The team will have key personnel in attendance with team principal
   Christian Horner and drivers Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat present
   to speak to the media about the season ahead.

   However, what won’t be there is the 2016 car.

   Instead, the team will use an old car painted in their 2016 livery to
   show off their new design.

   This is likely to be the team’s only launch event this year, with the
   former world champions expected to hit the track in Barcelona without
   an official photocall for the RB12 on February 22.
   [player] Will 2016 be another frustrating year for Daniel Ricciardo.

   Why launch an old car with a new look?

   [index&domain=heraldsun.com.au&td_widget=otherstories&widget=otherstori
   es]

   Using an old car means Red Bull can keep their new design under wraps
   and hidden from their rivals until testing.

   Aerodynamics is one of the team’s strengths and they will be wary of
   giving away any potential secrets they have found over the winter.

   Instead, the pictures of the new livery that will be splashed across
   media outlets will be of a car that has already been heavily
   photographed. The team and their new sponsors will still receive
   publicity, but no aero or packaging secrets will have been disclosed.
   [index&domain=heraldsun.com.au&td_widget=otherstories&widget=otherstori
   es] Daniil Kvyat of Russia drives during wet weather tyre testing at
   Circuit Paul Ricard in France on Australia Day.

   Is it normal for a team to be secretive about their design?

   Even in the days of spectacular, lavish launches, the car that would be
   pushed out onto the stage would never be the same as the one that hit
   the track for testing, or indeed the first race of the season.

   The basics of the car may have been there, and any dramatic changes to
   the shape would be obvious, but the front wing would be simplified — as
   would the aero around the rear of the car.

   The same is true of the show cars put on stands at motorsport shows
   around the world. With millions spent chasing a fraction of a second in
   lap time, teams aren’t going to let anyone with a smartphone snap a
   close-up picture of their designs.
   [index&domain=heraldsun.com.au&td_widget=otherstories&widget=otherstori
   es] Red Bull will be doing all it can to keep its secrets safe.

   So what will we learn next week?

   First and foremost we will see the team’s on-track livery for 2016.

   It is likely to be significantly different from recent seasons with the
   loss of Infiniti branding from the sidepods and Tag Heuer branding
   replacing Renault.

   The team will also be launching a new range of team-wear and replica
   clothing for fans as they partner up with Puma.

   It will also be an opportunity for the media to quiz the team on their
   expectations for the forthcoming season and what we can expect from
   their engine after a difficult 2015.

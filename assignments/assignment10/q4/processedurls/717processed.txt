San Diego to allow 'Founding Fathers' in city communications

Conservative group balked at manual asking employees to say "Founders"
instead

   San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer has bowed to pressure from a
   conservative legal group that protested longstanding guidelines in the
   city’s correspondence manual, which asks that employees not refer to
   the nation’s “Founding Fathers,” to avoid gender bias.

   The guidelines called for use of the phrase “Founders” instead.

[151]Was Mayor Kevin Faulconer right to lift the guideline against "Founding
Fathers" for city communications?

Yes 78% (212)

No 22% (59)

   271 total votes.

   “Suggesting that our Founding Fathers should be referred to as
   'Founder' is political correctness run amok," Faulconer said in a
   statement released to The San Diego Union-Tribune on Wednesday. "We are
   proud of our nation's history, and there is nothing wrong with
   referring to the Founding Fathers. At my direction, this was removed
   yesterday from the City's correspondence manual. The manual will be
   reviewed for other misguided examples that defy common sense and
   changes will be made accordingly.”

   The correspondence guide was recently updated in conjunction with a
   [152]$48,800 effort to create consistency in the city's visual image
   and communications. The initiative was related to Faulconer's project
   to refresh the city's online presence.

Bias-free language guidelines

   But the provision advising against the term "Founding Fathers" dates
   back at least until 2008, according to archived copies obtained by the
   Union-Tribune. The 2008 version preferred these terms for the Founding
   Fathers: "pioneers, colonists, patriots, forebears." By 2014, the
   "Founders" term was suggested instead.

   In endorsing the more traditional "Founding Fathers," Faulconer is
   bringing the city in line with The Associated Press stylebook, which
   most newspapers across America use.

   "Capitalize when referring to the creators of the U.S. Constitution,"
   the book says.

   Faulconer's spokesman, Craig Gustafson, initially said final approval
   of the latest San Diego correspondence manual update and visual style
   guide stopped with Amelia Brazell, the communications director who was
   replaced in that position on Jan. 30 without explanation. Brazell did
   not respond to a call on Wednesday for comment.

   Later in the day Wednesday, Chief Operating Officer Scott Chadwick took
   responsibility for any problems in the style guide.

   "While this was an administrative project that was undertaken by our
   Communications Department, that department reports to me," Chadwick
   said.

   In its letter on Monday that sparked mayoral action, the Pacific
   Justice Institute made reference to the upcoming Presidents Day
   holiday, saying the city rules abridged the free speech rights of city
   employees to use common everyday terms.

   “Many Americans, including city employees, will no doubt be surprised
   to learn that the city considers them biased for merely mentioning
   ordinary words and phrases, like ‘the common man,’ ‘mankind,’ ‘manmade’
   and ‘man up,’ to name a few of the parade of horribles,” the letter
   states. “Most alarmingly, though, is the guideline directive, on Page
   76, that city employees should refrain from mentioning those to whom we
   owe our most fundamental freedoms, the Founding Fathers. The manual’s
   inane attempt to recast the fathers as simply ‘the Founders’ reaches a
   level of political correctness, censorship and insensitivity toward
   time-honored American values that is indefensible.”

   The letter by senior staff attorney Matthew McReynolds went on to cite
   1,500 references in Supreme Court rulings to the “Founding Fathers,” by
   justices of all political stripes. It called on Faulconer, a moderate
   Republican, to rescind the rules.

   McReynolds on Wednesday welcomed the news that Faulconer had decided to
   drop the guideline against "Founding Fathers."

   “I would say this is a good first step," McReynolds said. "We will need
   to see the revised version of the guidelines to ensure that San Diego
   has truly understood the mistakes that were made and has worked to
   address them.”

[162]San Diego city guidelines on bias-free language

   [163]Download .PDF

   The city’s style guide states, “The City of San Diego is committed to
   the elimination of discrimination and bias in all forms. The City
   recognizes the need to use written and spoken language and behaviors
   that convey respect and inclusion of all people. We are aware of the
   need to use language that recognizes our diversity and does not offend,
   demean or exclude people on the basis of gender, race, ethnic group,
   religion, age, ability/disability, sexual orientation, gender identity
   and expression, familial or marital status, class, or political
   affiliations. Our goal is to encourage bias-free language - language
   that does not create or perpetuate real or perceived prejudice – in our
   written and spoken communication.”

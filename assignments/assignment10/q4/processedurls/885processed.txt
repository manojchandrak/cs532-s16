   ANDERSEN AIR FORCE BASE, Guam --

   Stopping for a moment to catch his breath, the Airman realized he was
   nearing the limit of his willpower.


   He placed his rucksack on the ground for a brief moment of rest and
   glanced toward the mountain peak ahead. He could hear the rain dripping
   from the tree branches above, soaking his gear and clothes.


   Exhausted, craving sleep, food and a warm bed, he played with the idea
   of giving up. Deep down, however, he knew this wasn’t an option. He
   took a deep breath, forced himself to take another step and continued
   with his squad up the ridge.


   Staff Sgt. Robert Keefe, the 736th Security Forces Squadron NCO in
   charge of training, was in the middle of the U.S. Army's Ranger School.
   It was his chance to prove his mettle as a combat-ready Airman among
   some of the military’s toughest warriors.


   Rangers are uniquely skilled service members who specialize in
   conducting airborne and air assault operations, seizing key terrain
   such as airfields, destroying strategic facilities and capturing or
   killing enemies of the nation. Only a few Airmen are given the
   opportunity to attempt to join this elite brotherhood.


   Located in Ft. Benning, Georgia, the school prepares volunteers in
   combat arms-related functional skills. With a 40 percent graduation
   rate from 2011-15, Ranger School is one of the most grueling training
   courses a military member can attend.


   “Ranger school is what I would consider the Department of Defense’s
   premier leadership course,” Keefe said. “It exists only to build the
   best leaders in combat for whatever branch you're in.”


   At Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, Keefe usually trains security forces
   Airmen to be proficient for contingency operations around the world.
   With 11 years of experience under his belt, the battlefield expert has
   sharpened his skillset with sniper training; learned how to survive and
   return with honor through evasion and conduct after capture training;
   and spent time as an investigator with a security forces unit at
   Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota.


   Preparing for Ranger School


   Early 2015, while providing security support for the president, Capt.
   Nathaniel Lesher, Keefe’s executive officer at the time, approached him
   and asked if he was interested in the opportunity of becoming a Ranger.


   “I selected Keefe to attend Ranger school because it was apparent that
   he was both physically and mentally tough enough to finish the course,”
   Lesher said. “He is the guy who subordinates look up to and peers
   respect. Additionally, Keefe excelled at all core tasks and physical
   requirements in order to attend the school and with a short notice
   completed another physically and mentally challenging school – the
   Close Precision Engagement Course – earlier in the year.”


   At first, Keefe shrugged it off thinking his captain was only joking.
   After all, only a handful of Airmen get the chance to join Army
   Soldiers each year.


   “When he first asked me, I told him ‘Sure I’ll go if you send me,’”
   Keefe said. “At first I didn't think he was serious, but he asked me
   again a few more times over the course of the next couple days. Then I
   thought that he might actually be serious.”


   After returning from a security mission in India mid-2015, Keefe’s
   leaders decided he was ready to represent his unit at Ranger school and
   succeeded in securing his place on the class roster.


   Keefe said his wife, Ayesha, is used to him being gone for months at a
   time due to contingency response missions or deployments so she and
   their two sons, Nicholas and Tighe, were very supportive with his
   decision to attend the school. Knowing how important it was to his
   boys, however, he made a promise to be home for Halloween. This
   commitment put Keefe on a tight timeline. To be back on Guam by that
   date required him to go straight through the course and pass all
   challenges without being recycled or phased back.


   To prepare himself for the imminent struggle, he attended the Ranger
   Training Assessment Course – a evaluation split up into two week-long
   phases. During the Ranger Assessment Phase (RAP) - Keefe persevered
   through unique tasks such as the Ranger Physical Fitness Test, a Combat
   Water Survival Assessment and various other physical fitness events. In
   addition, he learned troop leading procedures, patrolling techniques
   and small unit operations. In order to continue to the second phase,
   Keefe had to pass all RAP events.


   During the second phase, Keefe and other students rotated into
   leadership positions and proved their ability to successfully
   accomplish small unit combat operations from planning through
   execution. In addition, the instructors evaluated Keefe on his ability
   to lead squad-sized patrols.


   Once he successfully completed RTAC, Keefe gained passage into the
   Ranger course.


   What are you doing here, Air Force?


   Pulling up to the training center at 7 a.m., Keefe noticed he was the
   first one to arrive. He anxiously stepped out of the taxi and collected
   his baggage.


   After passing under a large Ranger tab suspended above him, he knew it
   was ‘go-time.’ Seconds later, a Ranger instructor stopped Keefe and
   asked “Air Force, what are you doing here?”


   Without hesitation, the Airman replied confidently, “I'm here for
   Ranger school.”


   The instructor chuckled and told him to go sit down. Listening to his
   instruction, Keefe placed his gear down beside him and took a seat on
   the training pad. While waiting for other trainees to arrive, he said
   he first questioned himself on what he was even doing there.


   As time passed and more students arrived, Keefe noticed the operational
   camouflage pattern uniforms. As he observed operators pulling off their
   patches, leaving only their name and service branch signifiers, he
   noticed he was surrounded by some of the Army’s most elite Soldiers as
   the only Airman among his peers.


   “I overheard some of the men talking and heard some say they were with
   Special Forces,” Keefe recalled. “I started to think ‘These are some
   real guys I'm sitting here with right now. These guys are going to
   dominate this course and I'm going to have a tough time.’


   “Then I thought ‘These guys aren't better than me, they're just like
   me’. They’re probably thinking the same thing I'm thinking right now -
   who is that kid and why is he in the Air Force? Why is he here, he must
   be something special.”


   Benning Phase


   The Benning phase kicked off the 61 days of hell for Keefe and the
   other students. In the first week, Keefe demonstrated his physical
   stamina and mental toughness by exceeding the minimum of 49 push-ups
   and 59 sit-ups in a two-minute span, six chin-ups and by running five
   miles in 40 minutes or less.  Nearly 40 percent of failures occur
   during the first few days of this phase. Seeing trainees drop out
   motivated Keefe to push through the physical pain and mental strain.


   Here, he was introduced to the instructors’ disciplinary measures. As
   often as they deemed necessary, the students were ordered to execute
   push-ups, sit-ups, squats and burpees until they were told to stop.


   “The instructors are pretty much holding your hand throughout that
   phase,” Keefe said of the frequent pressure. “They beat you into the
   ground all day long. They worked us till we didn’t want to breathe
   anymore, but they showed us exactly how to do everything. They wanted
   us to perform, so they were very critical on the way they graded us.”


   Keefe quickly realized how little sleep he was receiving during this
   experience. Sleep deprivation is part of the course and requires Ranger
   candidates to dig deep. Some nights he only slept for little more than
   15 minutes or not at all. Keefe noted the most sleep he got during the
   training was a trifling two hours.


   “One thing I learned about Ranger school is that I could literally
   sleep doing anything,” Keefe said. “I would sleep during conversations
   and at times, I would sleep walk. There was an instance when I woke up
   walking in the woods not knowing how I got there.”


   Halfway there - Mountain Phase


   After learning the tactical fundamentals during the Benning phase,
   Keefe found himself in the northern Georgia Mountains for the stage of
   challenges. Here, he learned about knots, belays, anchor points, rope
   management and the basic fundamentals of climbing and rappelling. In
   addition, he trained on how to properly evacuate simulated injured
   personnel and perform raids in a mountainous environment. Since Keefe
   had very little previous mountaineering experience up to this point,
   this segment proved to be difficult.


   Between hiking through the mountains ambushing training sites, Keefe
   found himself exhausted and pushed to his limits. Mother Nature didn’t
   make things any easier for Keefe either.


   “It rained on us the whole time we were there,” Keefe said. “It was
   terrible, our ruck sacks were already heavy enough and the rain just
   made it even heavier. There were times where my ruck would weigh in
   excess of 80-100 pounds.”


   Home stretch – Florida phase


   Battling exhaustion and hunger, Keefe knew he only had a few weeks left
   during the final stretch of the school. The finish line inched close,
   yet Keefe needed to survive the swamps of Florida. With his fellow
   classmates, he received instruction on waterborne operations, small
   boat movements and stream crossings upon arrival.


   “By this time, we were expected to operate without help from the
   instructors.” Keefe recalled. “You’ve got it all figured out at this
   point and the missions should go well. It was hot, humid and the
   mosquitoes were like dinosaurs. You live in a swamp and you're always
   soaking wet with mud, it wasn’t easy.”


   After braving some of the harshest environments of the continental
   United States, from mountain elevation to the humid heat of Florida,
   Keefe had proven that he met demanding requirements of the curriculum.


   Without delay and recycle, Keefe graduated from the school on Oct. 16,
   2015, and became the 266th Airman to earn the black and yellow Ranger
   tab. Not only did this enable to keep his promise to his sons, but
   according to Keefe, only 8 percent of students can say they
   accomplished this feat.


   “(I didn’t make it straight through) because I was (exceptional) or
   anything like that,” Keefe said. “It was because I had a bunch of
   people around me who helped me get to through it.”


   Not a day passed when Keefe didn’t experience a trial, but he knew he
   was never was going to be presented this opportunity again. Dreading
   the thought of returning to his unit and being known as a failure, the
   Airman fought tooth and nail to earn the title of a Ranger School
   alumnus.


   “Every single day I wanted to quit,” Keefe said. “I kept telling myself
   tomorrow you’re going to quit, then tomorrow came and I kept saying the
   same thing. I kept telling myself, if you quit then you're going to be
   that guy who says they made it to the second phase of Ranger school
   then quit.”


   Sporting the Ranger tab on his left shoulder, Keefe said he takes pride
   in knowing he is one of a few select Airmen who’s persevered through
   the grueling training and can now consider themselves a Ranger.


   “I wanted my kids to be proud, I wanted my wife to be proud and I
   wanted to do it not only for myself, but for everyone who is important
   to me,” he said.

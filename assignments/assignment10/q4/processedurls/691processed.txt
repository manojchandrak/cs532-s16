   Johnny Depp, Donald Trump

   Getty Images/FunnyOrDie.Com

   A spellbinding chameleon, [33]Johnny Depp has once again completely
   transformed himself into one of America's most prominent and colorful
   characters: [34]Donald Trump.

   In a nearly hour long satirical movie by Funny or Die, the Golden
   Globe-winning actor traded in his celebrity veneer for that of the
   Republican presidential hopeful. The parody takes place circa 1987 when
   the real estate mogul had just released his first book, Trump: The Art
   of the Deal.

   A #1 New York Times bestseller, the financial guide helped launch
   Trump's celebrity status as an American tycoon, an era of the Donald's
   life that is highlighted in this brand new sketch by Funny or Die
   featuring Depp, [35]Ron Howard, Alfred Molina and countless more
   surprise celebrities.

   Though it is Depp who steals the show from the start. While Trump has
   been parodied by many of Hollywood's great male comics,
   including SNL Taran Killam and Darrell Hammond, the Willy Wonka
   impressionist would fool anyone walking down the street when dressed in
   the proper suit, wig and prosthetics.

   [38]Funny Or Die Presents Donald Trump's The Art Of The Deal: The Movie
   from [39]Funny Or Die

   The premise of the sketch is simple—Howard found this old tape at a
   yard sale, written, directed by and starring Trump himself. Marked by
   chapters from his book, faux Trump takes us through his journey to
   secure the future Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City all while
   celebrating his 40th birthday.

   From the start, his secretary's reminders are subtle clues of what is
   to come in the businessman's life, including a note that "the actress
   from Maximum Overdrive's name is Marla Maples." Trump would go on to
   marry Maples, have a daughter, and subsequently divorce her in real
   life.

   In light of his recent New Hampshire primary win, a particular bit from
   his secretary notifying him that he is "no longer a registered
   democrat" rings equally amusing.

   Though, faux Trump is careful to remind us that becoming a billionaire
   was an uphill battle.

   "I had to start with the shirt off my back and a small million dollar
   loan from my father," he quipped.

   We're wiping our tears for you, Mr. Trump.

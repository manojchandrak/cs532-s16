First Nation students suffering from PTSD, school nurse tells inquest

   Many First Nation teenagers who leave home to come to Thunder Bay,
   Ont., for high school are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder
   (PTSD), according to a high school nurse in the city.

   Mae Katt testified on Tuesday at an inquest into the deaths of seven
   First Nations students who died in Thunder Bay between 2000 and 2011.

   "In the last seven or eight years, we're seeing a lot more acute
   conditions of mental health and substance use," said Katt, who has been
   serving remote First Nations as a nurse for more than 30 years.

   The students exhibit symptoms of PTSD including excessive worry,
   sleeplessness, headaches and "early psychosis" such as "auditory
   hallucinations — hearing voices," Katt said.

   School in Thunder Bay who says students soothe their feelings with
   drugs and alcohol when feeling low. (Mae Katt/Twitter)

   The nurse attributes the mental illness to "25 years of a suicide
   crisis that never got addressed" in northern Ontario's First Nations.

   There have been more than 500 suicides among the approximately 45,000
   First Nations people who live in the region in that time, Katt said.

   The current generation of students is the first to be raised in the
   "sub-culture of suicide," where their parents use drugs to cope with
   unresolved trauma, grief and loss, she explained.

   "Adults are not doing drugs by choice. If you look at what hasn't been
   done in the north, no one has invested to stop the suicide
   crisis," Katt noted.

   "Students tell me: if you really want to help us, help our home
   communities," the nurse told the inquest.

Nurse says students feel 'devalued'

   But life in the city isn't easy for the students, either, according
   to Katt.

   She said students talk to the school nurses about feeling "devalued" in
   Thunder Bay, adding that the "devaluing is related to their race" in a
   city where "no one really knows who they are."

   "We try to make them strong to try to make them understand they
   shouldn't be treated the way they're treated," Katt explained.

   The nurses' efforts don't always work and when students "feel pretty
   low, their reaction is poor-decision making," she said. "They soothe
   their feelings through drugs and alcohol."

   Dennis Franklin Cromarty First Nations High School, where Katt works,
   started a suboxone treatment program five years ago for students who
   are addicted to opioids.

   Katt said 50 students have taken part in the program and 11 have
   graduated.

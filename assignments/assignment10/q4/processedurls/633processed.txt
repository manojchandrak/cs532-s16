   Bilsdale Silver Band needs you!

   We are a very friendly, sociable, non-contesting Band that performs in
   some of the most beautiful place in North Yorkshire and Cleveland. The
   band extends a warm welcome to players of all abilities both young and
   old.

   There are no subscriptions and instruments, jackets and music are
   provided for free. Rehearsals are on Tuesdays at 7:30 in Chop Gate
   Village Hall near Stokesley, Helmsley and Guisborough.

   Why not come along and support your local band?

   We are always looking for new players.

   Please do not hesitate to contact the secretary at
   dolfair@tiscali.co.uk

   Also see our website at www.bilsdalesilverband.org.uk

   We have specific vacancies for solo cornets, repiano, back row cornets,
   tenor horn, bass and percussion, although we always accept players in
   other positions.

   Join us and let’s keep this brilliant band alive!

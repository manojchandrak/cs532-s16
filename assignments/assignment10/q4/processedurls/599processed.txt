   [90]Authored by Steve Keen, originally posted at Forbes.com,

   The great tragedy of the global economic malaise is that it is caused
   by a shortage of something that is essentially costless to produce:
   money.

   Both banks and governments can produce money at physically trivial
   costs. Banks create money by creating a loan, and the establishment
   costs of a loan are miniscule compared to the value of the money
   created by it—of the order of $3 for every $100 created.

   Governments create money by running a deficit—by spending more on the
   public than they get back from the public in taxes. As inefficient as
   government might be, that process too costs a tiny amount, compared to
   the amount of money generated by the deficit itself.

   But despite how easy the money creation process is, in the aftermath to
   the 2008 crisis, both banks and governments are doing a lousy job of
   producing the money the public needs, for two very different reasons.

   Banks aren’t creating money now because they created too much of it in
   the past. The booms that preceded the crisis were fuelled by a wave of
   bank-debt-financed speculation on some useful products (the
   telecommunications infrastructure of the internet, the DotCom firms
   that survived the DotCom bubble) and much rubbish (the Liar Loans that
   are the focus of [91]The Big Short). That lending drove private debt
   levels to an all-time high across the OECD: the average private debt
   level is now of the order of 150% of GDP, whereas it was around 60% of
   GDP in the “[92]Golden Age of Capitalism” during the 1950s and
   1960s—see Figure 1.

   Figure 1: The private debt mountain that has submerged commerce

   image002

   In the aftermath of the Subprime bubble, credit-money creation has come
   to a standstill across the OECD. In the period from 1955 till 1975,
   credit grew at 8.7% per year in the United States; from 1975 till 2008,
   it grew at 8% per year; since 2008, it has grown at an average of just
   1.5% per year. The same pattern is repeated across the OECD—see Figure
   2. Globally, China is the only major country with booming credit growth
   right now, but that will come crashing down (this probably has already
   started), and for the same reason as in the West: too much credit-based
   money has been created already in a speculative bubble.

   Figure 2: Credit growth is anaemic now, and will remains so as it has
   in Japan for 25 years

   image004

   Japan, of course, got mired in this private debt trap long before the
   rest of the world succumbed. As Figure 1 shows, its private debt bubble
   peaked in 1995, and since then it’s had either weak or negative credit
   growth, so that its private debt to GDP level is now in the middle of
   the global pack. Economic growth there has come to a standstill since:
   Japan’s economy grew at an average of 5.4% a year in real terms from
   1965 till 1990, when its crisis began; since then, it has grown at a
   mere 0.4% a year.

   That gives us a simple way to perform a “what if?”. What if the rest of
   the OECD is as ineffective at escaping from the private debt trap as
   Japan has been? Then the best case scenario for global credit growth is
   that it will match what has happened since Japan “hit the credit wall”
   in 1990.

   We can guess at that by shifting Japan’s credit growth data forward 18
   years, since its crisis began in 1990 while the rest of the world
   landed in the trap in 2008. Figure 3 shows the result of that
   exercise—here measuring credit growth as a percentage of GDP—and that
   predicts an average growth of credit from now till 2035 of 0.5% of GDP
   a year.

   It’s worse still when you consider that most of Japan’s post-crisis
   credit growth occurred in the first half decade or so after its crisis.
   Take those early post-crisis years out, and the average rate of growth
   of credit in Japan has been minus 3 percent of GDP a year. Rather than
   adding to the money supply, banks have been reducing it for the last 20
   years.

   Figure 3: Predicting future OECD credit growth on the basis of Japan’s
   record for the last 18 years.

   image006

   What about governments? Here we run into a problem with ideology—and
   bad metaphors. Inspired by visions of a no-government, free market
   idyll, conservative politicians from Reagan and Thatcher on have
   promoted restraints on government spending, in the hope that slashing
   government expenditure will allow the more efficient and dynamic
   private sector to fill the void. So the pressure has been on to reduce
   the size of the government sector, to avoid running deficits, and
   preferably to run surpluses, on the argument that the government is
   “like a household” and should “live within its means”.

   This vision would be all very well if we lived in a barter-based
   economy, but we don’t. In such an economy, exchanges could occur in
   kind—your pigs for my computers. But in the real world in which we
   live, trading pigs for computers—or anything else—requires money. And a
   government deficit, when it is financed by the Central Bank buying
   Treasury Bonds, is the other way that money is created. The fetish for
   small government and budget surpluses means that the government has
   ignored this task, and effectively abrogated money creation to the
   private banking sector.

   This strategy had no obvious negative consequences while the private
   banks were on a credit-money-creation binge—as they were effectively
   from the end of WWII till 2008. But once private debt began to dwarf
   GDP and the growth of credit slowed to a trickle, the inherent
   stupidity of this policy became apparent. In their attempt to promote
   the private sector, conservative proponents of small government are
   actually strangling it.

   As someone who spent 2 years warning about this crisis before it
   happened, and another 8 years diagnosing it (and [93]proposing
   remedies that would, I believe, be effective, if only banks and
   governments together would implement them), I find this dual idiocy
   incredibly frustrating.

   Rather than understanding the real cause of the crisis, we’ve seen the
   symptom—rising public debt—paraded as its cause. Rather than effective
   remedies, we’ve had inane policies like QE, which purport to solve the
   crisis by inflating asset prices when inflated asset prices were one of
   the symptoms of the bubble that caused the crisis. We’ve seen Central
   Banks pump up private bank reserves in the belief that this will
   encourage more bank lending when (a) there’s too much bank debt already
   and (b) banks physically can’t lend out reserves.

   How much longer can governments (and banks) continue with failed
   policies?

   On Japan’s record, the answer appears to be “indefinitely”. Japan’s
   latest inane attempt to reflate its economy was announced just last
   week: it will now charge negative interest rates on the excess reserves
   that Japanese banks now hold in their accounts at the Central Bank. The
   only direct impact of this policy will be to drive up asset prices yet
   again—and it might even lead to private banks increasing interest rates
   on loans to the private sector, [94]as has happened in Switzerland. The
   net effect on the real economy will at best be trivial, and it will do
   naught to reduce Japan’s private debt burden, which is the nub of its
   stagnationist problem.

   We are hostage to a dysfunctional monetary system, run by people who
   don’t understand how it works in the first place. No wonder the global
   economy is in the doldrums, and finance markets are having dyspeptic
   attacks.

   maybe Im misunderstanding this guy, but he keeps implying that the
   government can and should exert control over the money supply? As in,
   banks and the government should work together to control a kind of fiat
   currency together? no thanks. he seems to think that some central
   authority can and should exert control over monetary policy and
   interest rates, if only it can be done properly. No thanks. its been
   tried, over the last couple decades, and it doesn't work. Let the
   market work it out.


   If only there was something that was both universaly recognized and
   cannot be created at the whim of a central banker that we could use as
   money... maybe some day

   We've got Western total debt at ~ 320% of GDP vs historically stable
   150% of GDP.

   This quote is a beauty:

   "... And a government deficit, when it is financed by the Central Bank
   buying Treasury Bonds, is the other way that money is created. The
   fetish for small government and budget surpluses means that the
   government has ignored this task, and effectively abrogated money
   creation to the private banking sector. ...

   ... But once private debt began to dwarf GDP and the growth of credit
   slowed to a trickle, the inherent stupidity of this policy became
   apparent. In their attempt to promote the private sector, conservative
   proponents of small government are actually strangling it. ..."

   So somehow we have a shortage of money because of government fiscal
   problity. Gov isn't creating enough debt.

   This Keen guy is out of his mind.  And so is Forbes.com.

   The problem is with debt-based money, where the debt has to go to
   infiinity to keep the ponzi going.  The system is blowing up for
   reasons that were perfectly clear in 1913.

   We need sound money not banker debt money for stability.

   But that was never the goal.

   I mostly agree with you, but debt money really does not require
   exponential growth.  Details [144]here

   Steve Keen is just wrong about there not being enough money.  Debt
   money is created from a promise to (produce and) sell something of
   equal value later.  We're not suffering from a lack of promises – there
   are far too many promises being made.

   It's very easy to make promises.  The difficulty is in actually keeping
   them.

   If banks have created too much money in the past, in return for
   non-performing loans and other assets which are worth less than what
   was paid for them, the banks are sitting on a pile of losses. If those
   losses exceed the banks' capital, the promises of the banks can't be
   kept, and the money is worth less than is claimed. If the situation is
   allowed to reach that stage (which it shouldn't), the only way to
   return to health, and to the creation of money actually backed by
   realistic promises of the borrowers and banks is to recognise the
   losses, allocate them according to a just law, and then resume from an
   honest position.

   By the way, one other thing that Steve Keen gets wrong – the costs to a
   bank of creating a loan have to include the costs of absorbing any
   defaults. It's the same for a central bank: if a government gets the
   central bank to print money to make up the difference between spending
   and taxation, losses are accumulating in the central bank, and the
   money (central bank IOUs) is being steadily devalued.

   Steve Keen brought up a similar argument and it was completely
   shredded. In doing so, Steve Keen tucked his tail between his legs and
   ran away as fast as he could, never to be heard from again on the
   subject that showed him to be nothing but thinly veiled "controlled
   opposition" for the system that is enslaving us all.

   The Principal And Interest On Debt Myth
   [150]http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevekeen/2015/03/30/the-principal-and
   -inter...

   Read the Comments section for the complete and total exposure and take
   down of Keen's disingenuous arguments.

   Debt-Money Monopolist financed Steve Keen is a fraud.

   In short, there is enough money in the system to pay the interest so
   long as two things occur.

   First, the borrower has to pay the money originator (from debt
   issuance) and, second, EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR EARNED IN INTEREST MUST BE
   RETURNED TO THE LENDER OR THE DEBT IS INEXTINGUISHABLE.

   The latter NEVER occurs. In fact, the Debt-Money Monopolist corporate
   money center banks, the mega-corporations owned and controlled by the
   Debt-Money Monopolists, and the Debt-Money Monopolists themselves
   continue to siphon ever more money (that is the debt-receipts required
   to pay back the debt that generated them) from the suckers in society
   that being punked by this system.

   Read the comments section of the keen blog post for the full take-down.
   Don't choke on the dust that resulted from Keen jumping on his horse
   and leaving town when the fallacy of his argument was used to smack him
   across his face.

   Steve Keen is not your friend, rather, his job is to collect a
   Debt-Money Monopolist financed check running interference for the
   Debt-Money Tyranny system that is enslaving us all to Professor Keen's
   Debt-Money Monopolist "handlers."

   And, "NO," Steve Keen is not nearly as stupid as he pretends to be in
   the comments section once the fallacies of his argument are laid bare.

   Some of the "expert commentary" here is a total joke. Steve is not a
   Keynesian, he is in fact a post-Keynesian and one of the leading lights
   of the heterodox movement. He wrote the book Debunking Economics where
   he demonstrates more holes in the Neo-Classical and Keynesian schools
   than a swiss cheese. He is most definitely not paid by banks at all and
   in fact survives on a lecturers wages as head of economics at a London
   university. He has done more to challenge orthodox economics in the
   world of academia than any other economist today. He has been advancing
   the cause of Minsky for decades. Controlled opposition? Total b*ll*cks.
   You might not agree with verything he says, I don't, but he's probably
   the most honest economics academic out there.

   Can you defend the absurdity he posted in the comments here:

   The Principal And Interest On Debt Myth
   [166]http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevekeen/2015/03/30/the-principal-and
   -inter...

   Steve sure couldn't.

   And I bet you can't either.

   Until you do, Keen's obvious lies and obfuscations fit right in with
   controlled opposition. I don't make claims, I support my claims with
   actual data.

   The problem is that Keen's sheep suit is just a bit more sophisticated
   than you are, IMHO.

   If the Bank of Attempting-to-be-Devious refuses to spend its $1 billion
   of accumulated income, but holds on to it forever, the Bank of
   Arbitrage can buy slightly more than $1 billion of assets, goods and
   services for $1 billion. That $1 billion can be used to pay Bank of
   Attempting-to-be-Devious.

   It's slightly more complicated, because in theory BoAtbD could end up
   with all the base money, but chances are that they will get a bad
   reputation, all the good borrowers will borrow from good banks, the
   BoAtbD will end up with all the bad debts which no-one else will
   re-finance, and BoAtbD will go out of business, releasing all that base
   money.

   What you really don't want is to have a monopoly bank. If that refuses
   to spend its income, you do have the problem you're talking about
   (although it's the same if anyone hoards money, not just banks).

   So the solution is: insist on competition in banking.

   Hi striped, the problem exists right now. While I agree it isn't a hard
   dictatorship, I would dispute the idea that it is not a
   soft-dictatorship, a dictatorship that has been so successful because
   it chooses to give the masses just enough freedom for them to convince
   themselves that they are free.

   But they aren't really free.

   This dictatorship is hardening as the debt-money collapse is gaining
   moment.

   The velvet glove is thinning... and I bet you can guess what is
   underneath it.

   I agree that banking competition is an element of the solution. I would
   also add debt-free money NOT under the control of a private cabal of
   international bankers and an educated society passionate and active
   towards ensuring that no cabal can seize the Money Power from the
   country... or even the world.

   Try naming the countries the Debt-Money Monopolist vassal Western
   governments have attacked that was under the control of the Debt-Money
   Monopolists debt-money system.

   Can you name even one?

   Now name the countries that 1. were attacked by Western countries and
   2. ended up with a privately controlled central bank under the control
   of the Debt-Monopolists.

   That's pretty much every single country, right? Did you know that all
   the wars fought line up perfectly with debt-free or outsider debt-money
   system being brought in-line under the Debt-Money Monopolist system?
   Did they teach that in boot camp? Whose paying attention?

   Lastly, name the countries conquered by Western countries that didn't
   install a debt-money system under or aligned with the Debt-Money
   Monopolist system.

   The answers to those questions are quite revealing.

   Hi All Risk,

   I do see many convincing signs that Western governments are largely
   controlled by powerful private interests – a shadow government if you
   will. It's not as if it's completely hidden either, if you read the
   right sort of book, such as Public Opinion by Walter Lippmann,
   Propaganda by Edward Bernays, or Propaganda by Jacques Ellul.

   Having said that, I think we need to make sure we aren't manipulated
   into trying to attack the problem in the wrong way, so I am always wary
   of arguments along the lines of, "the current system is being
   manipulated, so we need a different system".

   My concerns with a debt-free paper money system are that:
    1. It is highly centralised, and therefore easier to control by the
       sorts of people who like to do that. I realise that you specified a
       system not under control, but I expect that sort of power would
       draw controlling types to it.
    2. It creates money whose value comes purely from diluting the value
       of existing money. I think of it as a confidence trick – the
       assumption is that it can be exchanged for something of value, but
       if the whole economy were liquidated, the holders of the money
       would get nothing. That's not true with debt-based money, in which
       liquidation occurs by those who have bought more than they have
       sold selling something to those who have sold more than they have
       bought, which seems much fairer to me.
       If you look at balance sheets, it appears that debt-free paper
       money is an asset of the holder, but not a liability of anyone
       else. That implies that the printing of such money increases
       someone's net worth without decreasing anyone else's i.e. that
       governments can create wealth by fiat. That's a huge red flag to me
       – it implies that there are equal liabilities somewhere, but that
       they are not being recognised, and it is not clear whose
       liabilities they will ultimately be. (But I'm prepared to bet that
       they won't fall on the well-connected shadow-government types).

   I'm sure you're right that education is a big part of it too, and I try
   to get people to understand, but I think that people don't want to put
   in lots of effort to make themselves feel much more uncomfortable, even
   if they have the time.

   Private bank money, in a competitive environment with no bail-outs, is
   the best system which I can think of for providing its users with
   economic freedom. It's really just private insurance of the value of
   people's IOUs. See my essay [182]here.

   Hi striped, I share some of your concerns.  No system will save us.
   Every system will be used against us UNLESS we, as a society, put in
   the effort to not be ignorant.

   Jefferson was right when he observed that anyone who expects to be
   ignorant and free expects what never has existed and never will
   exist...  but he said it better than I just did.  ;-)

   Allowing a private cartel to create trillions of interest accruing debt
   dollars and issue where they will, when nobody else can do so, is the
   antithesis of anything that could be consider free or just for everyone
   outside the Debt-Money Monopolist cabal.

   So that system has to go as it is one of the worst forms of issuing
   money to society out of all the bad systems.

   I have a friend who is in love with Ellen Brown and thinks Heaven on
   Earth would arrive if only government printed near unlimited amounts of
   debt-free money (as long as people "work," but it apparently doesn't
   matter what they do!).  He obviously doesn't understand the system...
   got Weimar?

   Also, guess who controls government?  It isn't the individual voter, it
   is the Debt-Money Monopoly that finances government.  And politicians.
   And media.  And schooling.  You get the idea.

   Debt-free money in the hands of government would lead to the Money
   Power to direct the money to themselves and keep it from the masses.
   They wouldn't hyperinflate, thought, as that would mean they'd lose out
   big, instead of the debtors.  But it would still be brutal.

   So I get back to the foundation of the matter - either every day
   Americans reprioritize their lives or the Debt-Money Monopolist plan to
   have their way with us will go down pretty much as they've engineered
   it to go down.

   My observation is the same as yours regarding the societal apathy and
   obsession with perceived personal comfort, hence, I recommend doing the
   best you can to make it through the coming economic terror storm.
   Getting control over the necessities of life, getting out of the
   banking and brokerage system (Treasury Direct is my play...  will
   dollar cost average out into physical assets as the economy collapses),
   and learn to smell the flowers, at least if you haven't already.

   This system will only work if there is enough land to exploit and
   there are not too many people fighing over the land.

    This is a finite planet and this entire sysytem will come crashing
   down at some point. We are rapidly approaching this point if we have
   not reached it already.

   When the MENA runs out of oil, where will the millions of people get
   money for food?

    I don't see anything wrong with a countries population declining and
   having more of everything a country has to offer to less people, but
   with our monetary system that is not possible.

   Creating anything out of thin air a recipe for disaster.

   We've been forced to live with all the negative aspects of a debt based
   monetary system whithout enjoying the positive - the ability to create
   "money" debt free.  Only gold and silver are actual money, but in an
   economy that functions on currency there is no reason to force every
   unit into existence with interest attached.

   Steve Keen, like Hyman Minsky, is an excellent and insightful
   diagnostician of our economic woes.

   He has made great contributions in showing how money creation actually
   happens. His work is a quantitative expose of the Ponzi nature of our
   financial system.

   That is why he used to be a guest with Max and Stacey.

   Thus, Steve Keens diagnostic work should be honored in the Austrian
   world.

   Unfortunately, ,like Minsky, he can't escape his Socialist matrix.
   So let us be thankful for his excellent diagnosis and be grateful. Then
   politely dismiss his insane, short sighted prescriptions.

   BTW, Hyman Minsky was my Econ 102 prof at Wash U. He looked, talked and
   acted , a lot like our beloved Murray Rothbard. He just wasn't lucky.
   Enough to study under Ludwig, and thus never questioned his good Jewish
   socialist roots in New York.

   Please forgive my spelling. The longer that I am blind, and never
   seeing words, only hearing them, the worse my spelling gets. Even
   experienced teachers at he lighthouse for the blind can't figure. Out
   the spell checker on the I stuff.

   Read the comments section - Steve's razor thin disinformation was

   model not being complex enough (which was total bull, the problems are
   very simple and they were exposed to him in the comments section.

   Steve isn't "mistaken," he's controlled opposition who valued his

   The Banksters understand the societal asset stripping system quite
   well. They also understand how to dupe the masses into falsely
   believing that they don't understand it as the system loots society
   into poverty and all the real assets fall into the laps of the
   mega-banks and their owners.

   Keen is a Keynesian.

   His solution is for the government to "borrow" from its central bank
   and spend it. His alternate solution is to enable the public to borrow
   again by declaring a debt jubilee. None of his solutions include
   returning to honest money instead of, by his own admission, this flawed
   ponzi we have now which requires infinite growth on a planet with
   finite resources.

   I used to like Keen when the financial crisis broke out (and his loans
   create deposits not the other way around economic model)but then
   realized he is nothing more than just another aggregate demand, pile on
   more debt to solve a debt problem, clueless Keynesian economist.

   Most modern money is bank deposits i.e. negotiable IOUs from the bank
   to the holder.  It is backed by two things:
    1. The obligation of the borrower to sell something of value into the
       market (which they have to do in order to repay the loan).
    2. Failing that (i.e. if the borrower defaults), the bank's obligation
       to make up the loss with its own capital - they pay on behalf of
       the defaulting borrower.  The shareholders forgo the ability to buy
       something from the market, allowing the holders of the money to buy
       those things instead.

   It is only if the borrower defaults AND the bank does not have enough
   capital to make up the difference that there's a problem for anyone
   else.

   That's why it's so important that banks are liquidated before their
   capital goes negative.  Hmm - missed opportunity in 2008.

   The point is that the banking and monetary system itself is fine, but
   allowing banks to overstate the value of their assets (such as
   non-performing loans) or understate the value of their liabilities
   (such as CDSs which they have written) is disastrous.

   Thanks for the offer, All Risk, but I don't need a loan at the moment.
   :-)

   I replied to one of your earlier comments, but there's something else I
   could add here.

   This idea of banks holding on to interest is a very serious point, and
   it's one which definitely needs plenty of thought. Deliberately making
   debts impossible to settle by restricting access to the means of
   repaying them is blatantly unjust.

   This is really an issue of debt in general, rather than specifically
   one of the debt-based monetary system. The same issue would occur in,
   say, a gold-backed monetary system. In fact, with gold, it would be
   easier to corner the market and make it impossible for others to repay
   their debts.

   It's also important to remember that anyone is capable of taking money
   out of circulation, not just banks. In fact, [333]The KLF burned £1
   million of cash, which is quite an extreme version of this.

   One important part of the solution to the problem of creditors making
   it difficult for debtors to repay is to have legal tender laws, forcing
   the creditor to accept a standard form of payment in settlement of the
   debt. It is still important that the means of settlement is not
   controlled by the creditor. So, if I borrow ARNRNs from you, I can
   force you to take FRNs instead of your ARNRNs in settlement. If there
   is a problem with banks, through controlling the Fed, making it
   impossible for solvent borrowers to obtain enough legal tender to repay
   their loans, maybe this is an area to push for change e.g. forcing
   creditors to accept a wider range of assets in settlement of debts.

   A question for you: is this a theoretical argument – that lenders could
   abuse the system if they wanted to? Or are you saying that there are
   people who are borrowing what they have good reason to believe they
   will be able to repay (with interest), and then finding it difficult to
   obtain enough money to repay?

   Thanks.

   Hi striped, I appreicate your interest and thoughts on this preeminent
   subject.

   >>A question for you: is this a theoretical argument – that lenders
   could abuse the system if they wanted to? Or are you saying that there
   are people who are borrowing what they have good reason to believe they

   “It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our
   banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be
   a revolution before tomorrow morning.  The one aim of these financiers
   is world control by the creation of inextinguishable debt.”
   [339]~Henry Ford

   Neither.  The debts are IMPOSSIBLE to pay back, right here, right now.
   That's the way the Debt-Money Monopolists engineered the system. The
   $20 example is EXACTLY how our debt-money system works.  I uber
   simplified it down to "one lego brick," but any structure has to built
   with duplicates of that one lego brick - each being faulty from the
   perspective of "Main Street" and "Alladin's Lamp" or, put another way,
   a systemt that makes alchemy look like it is for total chumps.

   Divide society into two groups:

   1. The Debt-Money Monopolists and their multinational cabal of
   corporations.

   2. Everyone else

   Group 1 has trillions in debt-money receipts (money thaty could pay
   back debts) over and above debt-money debts.

   Group 2 has trillions in debt-money debts over and above debt-money
   receipts (money to pay back debt)

   It is a balance sheet where monetary assets EQUAL monetary liabilities.

   I kid you not, but economists are taught that debt doesn't matter,
   BECAUSE WE OWE IT TO OURSELVES!  If you owe BofA and can't pay it, BofA
   takes your house...  that's not "owing yourself."  That's total crap,
   but total crap they must believe if they want to get PAID as an
   eCONomist.  Main Street has been enslaved to the Debt-Money Monopolist
   corporatocracy via, get this, BONDS!  At least they got the name right!

   The whole system is rigged.  It's all a fraud - top to bottom.  But it
   is a passive aggressive fraud that is subtle enough that the "frogs"
   don't ever feel the "water" heating up.  And that's the brilliance of
   it.

   There is one caveat, though, but it is a minor footnote.  Specie, or
   coinage, is debt free money.  That Susan B. Anthony dollalr coin is
   funadmentally different than a FRN bill.  One was minted and issued to
   society debt-free, the other was lent into existence and accrues
   PERPETUAL INTEREST to the coffers of the Debt-Money Monopolists even
   though they created it out of nothing (essentially borrowed it from
   nothing, but they pay no interest and only have to extinguish the money
   as principle is paid down).

   I think you can gain some insight by reading through this eviceration
   of Steve Keen's misinformation campaign in the comments section...

   The Principal And Interest On Debt Myth (exposed as misinformation in
   the comments section)

   Prior to 1973 we called gold "primary reserves' and all the cash and
   notes/bonds owned by banks was created off the capital that they were
   able to raise from shareholders. The Fed could tighten or loosen by
   buying/selling its primary reserves (gold). We have now strayed so far
   from that original idea that our leaders don't even know that all our
   money (except gold) is just debt. Banks are designed to be
   intermediators. They sped up and slow down the velocity of money by
   offering time deposits at various interest rates: the longer time
   deposits theoretically offer higher interest rates. The shorter ones
   offer less. But no one seems to understand that we have abandoned this
   idea.

   Congratulations, tunetopper: you actually provided a somewhat
   meaningful answer.

   "Banks are designed to be intermediators. "

   The monetary system will function much more soundly when banks are
   forced to once again function as intermediators, and cease to act as
   counterfeiters and speculators in the economy.


   "The Fed could tighten or loosen by buying/selling its primary reserves
   (gold). "

   1. How was the price at which this primary reserve asset ( Gold ) was
   bought or sold decided?

   2. How did the Fed decide who to buy or sell to at the price
   ascertained above?

   3. As per our recent adventures with oil price and availability
   volatility: how would similar effect a currency regime based on
   fractionalization of Gold?

   4. What is the 'proper' Gold / $US ratio?

   Banks as "intermediaries" is the propaganda. They are Debt-Money
   Monopolist societal asset stripping Trojan Horses engineered to screw
   you and yours 50 ways to Sunday... and none in a way that you will
   like.

   BTW, "pretend inferiority" is a Sun Tzu Art of War tactic along with
   "all war is deception" (propaganda believers have been punked) and a
   corollary of an Art of War insight is that any group selling never
   ending war has the goal of bankrupting the country's citizens.

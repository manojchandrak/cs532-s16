Two more Chicago cops must be investigated for racist ‘hunting’ photo,
family demands

   [43]Kim Janssen
   [44]email

   A black West Side uncle who says he witnessed four white Chicago cops
   force his teenage nephew to pose in a series of racist and degrading
   photos has demanded that Mayor Rahm Emanuel launch an investigation
   into two officers he says have yet to be held accountable.

   Two officers, who appear in the now infamous photo toting rifles as
   they hold a black man with antlers on his head as if he were a hunting
   trophy, are no longer with the department. A third cop who took the
   picture and a fourth who posed in other degrading photos that night in
   2003 should also be named and punished, said the uncle, Robert Smith,
   50.

   “Is Mayor Emanuel going to put a full investigation into what I’m
   saying to see if its true?,” Smith said at a news conference Friday
   afternoon. “All of them should be fired . . . what about the other two?
   They should be identified.”

   One of the officers in the photo, Jerome Finnigan, is in federal
   prison, serving time for leading a crew of dirty cops who kidnapped
   drug dealers and for plotting the murder of a fellow cop. The other,
   Tim McDermott, was fired last year after the FBI passed the photo to
   Chicago Police and is fighting to get his job back.

   Police say they have been unable to identify either the officer who
   took the photo inside the Harrison District police station or the black
   male depicted in it. But Smith on Thursday told the Sun-Times that the
   man is his late nephew, Michael Spann, that he is sure he could pick
   the officer who took the photos out of a lineup and that there are more
   degrading photos of two other officers posing with Spann. Smith added
   that the officer who took the photo volunteered that he had the same
   birthday as Smith when the officer ran a background check on him — a
   detail that might make his identification easier.

   Supt. Garry McCarthy in an emailed statement on Friday repeated his
   earlier comments that “the photo is disgusting and not reflective of
   the Chicago Police Department’s values” adding that “there is no place
   in the CPD for an officer who would participate in such activity,”
   describing the investigation as “active.”

   “If additional officers are identified, swift action will be taken,” he
   said.

   Still, Smith and his brother  — Spann’s father, Michael Smith — say
   police have made no attempt to talk to them since the Smiths identified
   Spann on local TV news and to the Sun-Times.

   “Nobody came to me and asked me nothing,” Robert Smith said. “No
   internal affairs, no officers . . . nobody said nothing. I guess
   they’re still claiming that that is not Michael Spann in that picture.
   C’mon now!”

   “In that picture is Michael Spann . . .  that is not [an] unidentified
   person. I was standing next to him in handcuffs, wondering if I was
   gonna be next.”

   An emotional Michael Smith teared up at Friday’s news conference as he
   described his grief at seeing the photo for the first time last month
   when it was published in the Sun-Times, eight years after his son was
   killed in a drive-by shooting.

   “When I saw this picture my heart broke,” Michael Smith said, adding
   that though his son had told him about the degrading photos, he never
   had any evidence to back up his claim until the photo finally surfaced
   last month.

   His son was terrified of police after the incident and “would take off
   running” whenever he saw them, though he had committed no crime, he
   said.

   “He was scared to death of the police . . . and I don’t blame him,” he
   said. “That picture was disgusting.”

   "I only need to go to Lab and search for a specific topic. The toolkits
   are of a high quality and there is an extensive toolkits that are
   available. I am wondering if there is an area for which a toolkit is
   not available"
   "The wide variety of toolkits is useful."
   "I am very excited to have those toolkits available to me. They are of
   high quality, awesome, and so many IT topics are being covered.
   It is clear for me what I can expect / get from you and your team.
   Your turn-around on answering my emails is amazing!
   As always, Thanks to the Art of Service team"
   "I subscribed to the art of service as it has most of the information
   I’m looking for is in one location. I’m always looking to learn and
   improve. It also seems that you have experienced the same challenges
   and have learned from that and are willing to share that knowledge.
   In my experience, knowledge sharing within organisations very limited
   as it is seen as power, rather than an enabler."
   "I want to be able to increase my knowledge base very quickly so be
   able to be effective at work, leading by example and reapplication."
   "I like the quality of the material"
   "one location where you can search information about so many areas of
   IT"
   "the monthly cost is attractive"

   "Even after 30+ years in the IT Service space I often look for "best
   practices" - and usually find "something that a friend of a friend has
   supposedly set up and might have it running somewhere ..."
   So your lab is a wonderful source of "inspiration".
   Thank you"

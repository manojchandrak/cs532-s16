   Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt leaves Downing Street

   Junior doctor Rachel Clarke wants an interview with Jeremy Hunt (but
   she isn't going to get one)
   Advertisement - Continue Reading Below

   As the conflict between doctors and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt
   continues, one junior doctor has grabbed the headlines with a
   stunningly eloquent interview on BBC News.

   Yesterday (February 8) on The Andrew Marr Show, Hunt was read letters
   by junior doctors, including one from Dr Rachel Clarke.

   Hunt claimed that the reason for the conflict was the British Medical
   Association (BMA) union, who he called "totally irresponsible".

   Speaking later on BBC News, Clarke said: "It's extraordinary for me as
   a frontline Junior Doctor to hear my Health Secretary say that."

   She added that she hoped he would take the concerns of frontline staff
   seriously, but instead "he seemed there to have used my concerns as an
   opportunity to score a cheap political point at the expense of the
   BMA".

   Clarke added: "He says he cares about junior doctors' morale, so I can
   tell him now that the single biggest problem for my morale - the thing
   that is making me want to quit my profession at the moment - is not the
   BMA.

   "It's nothing I hear from my union or read in the press. It is what he,
   my Health Secretary, says.

   "It is the way he spins against us, he manipulates statistics against
   us and frankly he lies. One striking example being he claims to the
   media we would receive an 11% pay rise in his contract

   "It sounded very slick, it was nice spin for the media. Every junior
   doctor in the country looked at the detail in his contract and saw that
   alleged pay rise was offset by stringent cuts in our pay elsewhere."

   Pushed on the matter of Hunt's honesty, she added: "I'm saying he's
   lying."

   The junior doctor's [236]strike dominated social media for the 24 hours
   during the walkout.

   #JuniorDoctorsStrike was a leading trend throughout the day, and
   celebrities like[237]JK Rowling and Jack Thorne gave their support to
   the doctors.

   Clarke went on to write a column for [238]The Independent urging Hunt
   to engage with junior doctors and resolve the conflict.

   "We are sick and tired of being spun against because trust, more than
   anything, is our profession's core value," she said.

     School run this am. My 9 yr old: "'mummy, why won't Jeremy be
     interviewed with a doctor? Is it because he thinks they would
     overpower him?"

     — Rachel Clarke (@doctor_oxford) [239]February 10, 2016

   "We earn our patients' trust through acting with honesty and integrity,
   and we expect the same from our health secretary.​"

   Clarke has continually called on Hunt to debate with her but he has
   seemingly declined all invitations.

   On February 11, Hunt announced that talks with the medical union had
   failed  and he will impose a new contract on junior doctors from August
   1.

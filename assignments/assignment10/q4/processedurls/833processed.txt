   Warning!

   Users of this web resource are warned that it may contain images and/or
   references to deceased people, which could cause distress or sadness
   particularly for some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

   The resource may also contain words and descriptions that could be
   culturally sensitive and which might not normally be used in public or
   community contexts. For example, some information may be considered
   appropriate for viewing only by men or only by women. The HealthInfoNet
   respects such culturally sensitive issues, but, for technical reasons,
   it has not been possible to provide materials in a way that prevents
   access by a person of the other gender. Users are asked to respect this
   cultural protocol.

Gap report 'must focus on ice problem': Wilson

   Date posted: 10 February 2016

   With today's release of the federal government's Closing the gap
   report, Aboriginal Drug and Alcohol Council South Australia (ADAC)
   Director, Scott Wilson, believes that the ice problem should be high on
   the agenda.

   Mr Wilson believes that ice is now an intergenerational issue and he
   has seen 'numerous instances' of families where grandparents, parents
   and children are all using the highly addictive drug. 'We know that you
   can score here in Adelaide for as cheap as $5 - that will give you
   enough to get you off for the day.' he said.

   Mr Wilson said the Closing the gap report had focused on Fetal alcohol
   syndrome but beyond that was more general, looking at issues like
   health services and workforce development.'The big elephant in the room
   is there is not a lot in (the report) that says drugs and alcohol
   should be part of the focus,' said Mr. Wilson.

   Mr. Wilson does not believe that current approaches to the problem
   work: he said that 'a lot of meth users are not necessarily violent'
   and that the TV ads depicting ice users as highly violent people just
   creates fear of ice users, from people who should be able to help.

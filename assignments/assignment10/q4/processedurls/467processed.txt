   Chapel Hill Public LIbrary Chapel Hill Public LIbrary

   The Chapel Hill Public Library is planning to add four to six hours to
   it’s current schedule.

   Before deciding when these hours would be, the library is asking for
   [26]public input to help figure out which hours would best serve the
   community.

   The deadline to submit input is February 15.

   According to the library website, these expanding hours will come with
   no increase to the current budget.

   The library will announce its expanded hours in March.

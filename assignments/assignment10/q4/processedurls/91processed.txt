   Clueless New Hampshire voters handed billionaire bore Donald Trump a
   “yuge” victory in the first-in-the nation primary Tuesday, providing
   the mad mogul with a new round of ammo a week after a disappointing
   second-place finish in Iowa.

   NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY 2016:[20] LIVE RESULTS MAP

   More than three in 10 Granite State voters flocked to the foul-mouthed
   contender, throwing their support to him at levels beyond what the
   polls had predicted — a day after he referred to a [21]Republican
   challenger Ted Cruz as a “pussy.”

   With more than 89% of the state’s precincts reporting, the bloviating
   businessman had the support of 35% of voters.

   The race was called shortly after polls closed around 8 p.m., prompting
   supporters camping out at the former reality show star’s headquarters
   in Manchester to shout his name and wave foam fingers emblazoned with
   the phrase, “You’re Hired.”

Donald Trump has won the New Hampshire Republican primary.

   At a victory rally, Trump thanked the state’s “special” brainless
   voters who jumpstarted his momentum in the race.

   “I have so many friends up here. They are special, special people. We
   love you,” he said. “You started it, remember, you started it,” he
   added, before jumping into his regular stump remarks.

   "We are going to make America great again, but we're going to do it the
   old-fashioned way," he said as an excited crowd chanted, "USA, USA."
   "Were going to beat China, Japan, Mexico.”

   "We are going to do something so fast, and so good, and so strong. The
   world is going to respect us again, believe me," he added, going on to
   double down on a handful of familiar promises.

   “I am going to be the greatest jobs president that God ever created,”
   he said. “We’re going to build a wall, it’s going to be built … It’s
   not even a difficult thing to do."

   [24]DONALD TRUMP A SEXIST? AS A BOSS, HE TREATED MEN AND WOMEN EQUALLY

   Coming in second place in the primary was Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who
   was declared the official silver-medalist with about 16% of the vote.

   Trailing Kasich was a pack of establishment candidates including Texas
   Sen. Cruz, with 11.6%, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, with 11% and
   Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, with 10.5%.

   Chris Christie, who had campaigned heavily in New Hampshire, got only
   7.5% support, returns showed, prompting the outspoken governor to say
   that [25]he would “go home to New Jersey” on Wednesday to “take a deep
   breath,” leading many to believe he was on the verge of dropping out of
   the race.

After a poor outcome in New Hampshire, Chris Christie might soon drop out of
the race.

   Ben Carson managed a paltry 2%.

   Trump’s overwhelming victory came after days of outrageous comments
   that the mogul was apparently using to bolster his image as a blunt
   straight-talker.

   On Monday night, he tore into rival Cruz, who edged him in last week’s
   Iowa caucuses, referring to him as a “pussy,” after a supporter yelled
   out the slur to a crowd.

   [26]CHRIS CHRISTIE PACKS UP AFTER LOSING N.H. PRIMARY TO PONDER
   PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

   The day before, he told supporters that he would “look in (the) faces”
   of Syrian refugee children seeking asylum in the U.S. and [27]tell
   them, “You can’t come here.”

   On Sunday, he said during a television interview that, when it came to
   interrogating terrorism suspects, he’d [28]“go a lot further than
   waterboarding.”

   And just weeks ago, Trump rolled out a long list of bizarre
   endorsements to play up his support among anti-immigrant white voters,
   including [29]backings from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and
   controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio.

   New Hampshire voters gobbled it all up, with Trump crushing his
   competitors as badly as he has blindly promised to crush ISIS, illegal
   immigration, gun control and China’s currency manipulation.

   Before the Iowa caucuses, in which [30]Trump was beaten by Cruz and
   barely edged Rubio, the mogul had appeared to uncharacteristically
   soften his approach and exhibited unprecedented anxiety when asked if
   he would win.

   But after the loss, which many insiders predicted might forecast his
   demise, Trump returned to form, [31]blaming Cruz of using dirty tricks
   to steal the caucuses.

   GREENMAN: [32]NOMINATING DONALD TRUMP WOULD THROW AWAY GOP DIGNITY

   Trump’s gold-medal finish Monday prompted both conservative and
   liberal-leaning groups to blast his good fortune — and what it could
   mean for the country if he were elected president.

   “Tonight, a candidate who supports high taxes, government-run health
   care, bailouts, and the abuse of eminent domain won a Republican
   primary,” David McIntosh, president of the conservative anti-tax group
   Club for Growth, said in a statement. “Donald Trump’s current attempts
   to feign conservatism are at sharp odds with his years of emphatic
   support for liberal policies and politicians.”

   Planned Parenthood, meanwhile, said a Trump presidency “would be a
   disaster.”

   “Trump’s clear contempt for women, for immigrants, and for communities
   of color would have a devastating consequence for our country,” Dawn
   Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund,
   said in a statement.

   Tuesday’s results marked a notable triumph for Kasich, who without a
   strong placing would have likely dropped out of the race, and a
   remarkable setback for Rubio, whose solid third-place finish in Iowa
   led to a slew of high-profile endorsements.

   Kasich had aimed his entire campaign strategy at performing well in New
   Hampshire and was endorsed in the weeks leading up to the contest by
   eight newspapers in the state as well as The New York Times.

   “There’s magic in the air with this campaign,” Kasich, who kept a
   promise to avoid going negative in his campaign, said at his own rally
   Tuesday night.

   “Tonight, the light overcame the darkness of negative campaigning,” he
   added.

   “We see this as an opportunity to be involved in something bigger than
   our own lives, something that will restore the spirit of America and
   that will leave no one behind,” he said.

   Rubio, for his part, took responsibility for his lackluster finish.

   "Our disappointment is not on you, it's on me,” he said.

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio appears to be having a disappointing night in New
Hampshire, following criticisms of being too robotic in the final GOP debate.

   “I did not do well on Saturday night,” he added about a bizarre debate
   performance over the weekend. “But listen to me: That will never happen
   again."

   BARBARA A. RES: [34]MY BOSS DONALD TRUMP LEERED AT PRETTY EMPLOYEES

   Rubio suffered a major mishap Saturday at the last debate before the
   primary, when he responded to criticism by Christie with a repetitive,
   [35]robotic delivery of anti-Obama talking points.

   He was lampooned in the days following the debate and continued to
   repeat the very same talking points throughout several campaign stops
   in the state before Tuesday.

   Trump, in contrast, spent his final days before the primary
   crisscrossing the state [37]insulting Rubio, as well as Bush, who he
   dubbed a "total stiff" and a "spoiled child" who “couldn’t find a job”
   outside government.

Local residents arrive at the town hall to vote for the primary in in
Canterbury, N.H. on Tuesday.

   The comments, however, didn’t appear to harm Bush, whose finish in New
   Hampshire will amount to a success for the former governor’s campaign,
   which had been left for dead following a series of missteps and gaffes.

   Christie’s poor finish, meanwhile, likely foretells his exit from the
   race.

   "We've decided we're going to go home to New Jersey tomorrow, take a
   deep breath … and see exactly what happens,” the New Jersey governor
   told supporters late Tuesday.

   Despite its stupefying selection Tuesday, New Hampshire has had a
   fairly strong record in recent election cycles of predicting the
   eventual Republican nominee. The winner of the state’s primary has gone
   on to be the GOP nominee in 1980 (Ronald Reagan), 1988 (George H.W.
   Bush), 2008 (John McCain) and 2012 (Mitt Romney).

How you can 'Kondo' your phone to declutter your screen and your mind

       iPhone apps and headphones ShutterstockMake your iPhone more zen
       with the Kondo method.
       Marie Kondo is a Japanese lifestyle guru and author of "[19]The
       Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering
       and Organizing.” She's known for helping people decrease clutter
       and straighten up their homes.
       But it turns out [20]her method — which involves holding each item
       you own in your hands and asking if it gives you joy — could also
       help us declutter our electronic devices.
       Smartphones have rid of us of a lot of clutter, such as notepads,
       recorders, calendars, and recipe cards.
       But that doesn’t mean your phone itself can’t get messy, especially
       with myriad notifications popping up on your screen or hundreds of
       apps to download.
       The Wall Street Journal’s Christopher Mims realized he could use
       Kondo’s method on his phone and wrote about it in his article
       “[21]The Magic of Tidying Up — Digitally.” [22]Speaking with
       [23]WNYC Studios’ [24]Note to Self podcast team, Mims described how
       he would click on each app and ask himself if it gave him joy. If
       not, he’d promptly delete it and move on to another app and another
       app until he had gone through his entire phone.
       [25]Kondo herself told Business Insider you can tell when something
       sparks joy when you "feel your body go upward." If something
       doesn't make you happy when you touch it, Kondo said you should
       "thank it for its service" and get rid of it, or in this case,
       delete the app from your phone.
       After he deleted all of his unnecessary apps, Mims would then place
       all of his remaining apps into one folder and forget about them
       until he needed them.

       "By putting all of [your] apps into folders, you can search for
       them by name [using the Spotlight tool in your iPhone],” Mims told
       Note to Self. “What happens is your device becomes task-oriented,
       instead of the place [where] you go to be like, 'OK, what do I need
       to do next?'"
       By shedding unnecessary apps that he wasn’t using, Mims said he was
       left with 82 apps. That may seem like a lot, but 80 is actually the
       average number of apps the typical iPhone user has, [26]according
       to Apple.
       But the “Kondo”-ing of his phone didn’t stop there. Mims also
       suggests turning off notifications on apps when they aren’t
       necessary. That way instead of seeing thousands of red notification
       markers, you won’t see any.
       Can you imagine how zen that would be? Here's what my homescreen
       looks like after going through the process. To be honest, it's a
       little scary.

       According to Kondo herself, using her method will surround you with
       the things that you love and give you more storage than you thought
       possible, something that also applies to our digital life.
       Kondo for her part is flattered that Mims uses her method like
       this.
       “It’s very nice,” she told Note to Self. “When you tidy and
       organize things using my method, it’s very important that you only
       keep things that spark joy for you, but also to keep it simple, so
       this is a very good way to do that.”

   him on a par with old foe Pep Guardiola, who will join rivals
   Manchester City this summer. Personal terms are understood to have been
   agreed in principle with Mourinho, who is also keen to bring in
   highly-rated Atletico Madrid sporting director Andrea Berta and has
   already spelled out his potential summer targets to the club.

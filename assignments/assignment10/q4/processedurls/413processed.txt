   Anger: Julian Assange's alleged rape victim says he should "face up to
   his responsibilities"

   Julian Assange’s [128]alleged rape victim has urged the WikiLeaks
   founder to “take responsibility” saying she wants “vindication”.

   The woman, named only as SW, hit out after a United Nations panel ruled
   he should walk free from his Ecuadorian embassy bolt hole – and receive
   compensation.

   The alleged victim said: “The [129]UN panel’s decision and judgement
   are offensive. I want vindication.

   “[130]Assange should take responsibility and let the investigation move
   forward.”

   Furious [131]David Cameron branded the UN decision “ridiculous”, while
   SW’s lawyer urged Mr Assange to “pack his bag”.

   Anger: David Cameron has branded the UN's decision on Julian Assange as
   "ridiculous"

   The Australian fugitive, 44, is wanted for questioning in Sweden over
   an alleged sex offence dating back to 2010, but he is refusing to leave
   the embassy in Central London.

   He claimed asylum there in 2012, because he feared Sweden would send
   him to the US to face [133]espionage charges over the release of
   classified documents.

   SW’s solicitor Elisabeth Massi Fritz told the Mirror: “The panel seems
   to have a lack of understanding of the fact the alleged rape of a woman
   is one of the most serious violations and abuses of human rights.

   “That a man arrested on probable cause for rape should be awarded
   damages because he has deliberately withheld himself from the judicial
   system for over five years is insulting and offensive to my client –
   and all victims.

   “It is time that Assange packs his bag, steps out of the embassy and
   begins to cooperate with the Swedish Prosecuting Authority.”

   The defiant computer hacker addressed supporters from the embassy
   balcony.

   Victory: Julian Assange says the UN's ruling is of historical
   importance

   He told them: “How sweet it is. This is a victory that cannot be
   denied.

   "It is a victory of historical importance not just for me, for my
   family, for my children, but for the independence of the UN.”

   But [135]Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said: “Julian Assange is a
   fugitive from justice.

   "He is hiding from justice in the Ecuadorian embassy.

   "He can come out any time he chooses... but he will have to face
   justice in Sweden if he chooses to do so.”

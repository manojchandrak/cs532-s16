Watch Thomas Rhett's Laid-Back 'Happy Man' on 'Fallon'

Multi-week Number One "Die a Happy Man" heads to late-night television

   Thomas Rhett began 2016 with what is likely to be one of the year's
   biggest country songs: the multi-week Number One "Die a Happy Man."
   Even after it fades from heavy rotation on radio, the second single
   from Rhett's [186]ACM-nominated album Tangled Up is destined to be a
   wedding staple for years to come.

   Hear Nelly's Thomas Rhett Cover »

   Last night, Rhett visited The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon to sing
   the song and gave a relaxed performance that played up the casual
   soulfulness of its grooves. With some tasteful, emotive steel guitar
   flourishes to complement him, Rhett's declarations of love for his wife
   are powerfully sincere and pure — no doubt part of what made the song
   such a huge hit.

   That makes it a tough act to follow, both in Rhett's live show and as a
   radio release.

   "Even in our set, it's like, 'Well, what do you play after that?'"
   Rhett tells Rolling Stone Country. "Because it's the biggest moment of
   your set and anything after that is just set up to be thrown up and
   shot and killed."

   Rhett opted to change gears and released the up-tempo, sexy "T-Shirt"
   as the third single from Tangled Up, while rapper Nelly just
   [187]released his own pop-ready version of "Die a Happy Man."

 STOPPING IMATA TRAINERS FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE CRUEL TAIJI DOLPHIN CAPTURES

   Oct 02, 2015 | Mark J. Palmer, Int'l Marine Mammal Project

   Topics:

   I have just returned from Nassau in the Bahamas, where the
   International Marine Animal Trainer’s Association (IMATA) is having
   their convention.

   IMATA is the association representing the people who train dolphins,
   belugas, orcas, seals and sea lions in marine shows in aquariums around
   the world.  They are strongly pro-captivity for these unique marine
   beings.

   I went there to deliver a letter in person from the Save Japan Dolphins
   Campaign of Earth Island Institute – a letter endorsed by many
   individual scientists and marine activists as well as a host of
   organizations working to protect the oceans and marine mammals.

   Our message is simple: We are asking IMATA to follow the World
   Association of Zoos and Aquariums in denouncing the captures of
   dolphins during the horrendous Taiji dolphin drive hunts going on right
   now in Japan, and further to take action against its members who
   participate in the capture, training, selling or buying, and otherwise
   involved in removing these dolphins from their families and subsidizing
   the brutal hunts by paying top dollar for “show quality” dolphins.

   In 2013, IMATA posted a weak statement condemning the killing of
   dolphins in Taiji, but they do not denounce their colleagues who help
   the hunters by paying for and catching live dolphins for a life in
   captivity, torn from their families who are butchered.

   Their statement goes further to say: ”Claims that international and
   Japanese aquariums are driving the demand for the Taiji drive fishery
   to continue are false.”   In fact, it is well known that the high
   premiums paid by the captive industry for live dolphins (as much as
   $150,000 or more) is far more money than the hunters get for a dolphin
   carcass for the meat trade (about $500 to $600).

   IMATA then states the importance of “extending membership to
   individuals who work for organizations that acquire dolphins from a
   drive fishery.”  These individuals should be finding other jobs, not
   contributing to the destruction of dolphins that they claim to “love.”

   IMATA further claims:  “Extremist groups that oppose having any marine
   mammals in human care in zoos, aquariums, and marine parks target IMATA
   by using misinformation and emotional appeal for funding support, often
   through social media campaigns.”  This false claim is right out of the
   playbook of SeaWorld, to smear organizations like Earth Island
   Institute that work to protect marine life and prevent the
   incarceration of dolphins and whales in small concrete tanks to do
   circus tricks for the public.

   Here is the text of our letter and a list of endorsements:

   We the undersigned organizations and scientists respectfully urge the
   International Marine Animal Trainer’s Association (IMATA) to take
   action against the brutal and unscientific dolphin drive hunts
   conducted in Taiji, Japan.

   Specifically, we ask that:

   A. IMATA should renounce the Taiji dolphin drive hunt's capture of
   cetaceans BOTH for slaughter and for live animal sale to captivity
   facilities.   Both practices completely fail to meet anti-cruelty and
   ethical practice standards that IMATA should subscribe to.  The hunts
   are conducted under quotas that are never met, and these populations of
   dolphins have never been adequately studied.  Funds from sale of
   dolphins for captivity help subsidize the hunts.

   B. IMATA must immediately require that its members cease participation
   in all aspects of the cruel Taiji dolphin drives.  In the same way that
   the World Association of Zoos & Aquariums has prohibited its members
   from purchase of any dolphins caught in the Taiji dolphin hunts, IMATA
   must prohibit its members from any involvement with Taiji dolphins.

   C. Any member of IMATA continuing to be involved in activities
   including the capture, selection, training, transport or exhibition of
   Taiji-caught dolphins should face expulsion from IMATA.

   We encourage IMATA to take action at your IMATA Conference in Nassau
   this week.  Thank you for your consideration of our concerns.

Nissan says the 2017 Armada is "a strong, durable and authentic full-size SUV
with ruggedness to spare."

   CHICAGO -- An Armada is a fleet of warships and the redesigned Nissan
   Armada full-size SUV revealed this evening in Chicago does a good job
   of living up to that name.

   The 2017 Armada is built on a new, rugged body-on-frame platform, has
   room for eight passengers and is equipped with a new V8 engine with 390
   horsepower.

   The Armada's platform was derived from the platform Nissan uses for
   the Infiniti QX80 SUV as well as the Nissan Patrol — a hefty SUV that
   Nissan sells globally but not in the U.S.

   The Patrol, which traces its history to 1951, has been used by the
   United Nations peacekeeping forces.

   Richard Miller, director of product planning for Nissan in North
   America, said the automaker adapted the platform to make it better
   suited for family vacations than toiling in the Sahara.

   "(The Patrol) is known as a severe, off-road vehicle," Miller said
   during a media briefing Wednesday afternoon in Chicago. "The Armada is
   not for the severe off-road driver. Hauling boats and family adventures
   — that's what the Armada is built for."

   Miller said the ride and handling of the new Armada is better than the
   outgoing version and is "whisper quiet" inside.

   The key differences between the 2017 Armada and the previous generation
   include:

     * A new exterior design
     * A new 390-horsepower, 5.6-liter V8 engine that is mated with a new
       7-speed automatic transmission.
     * A number of available safety and security features including:
       collision warning, blind spot intervention, backup collision
       intervention, and moving object detection.
     * A quieter, "library level," riding experience for passengers.
     * Is 1.2 inches longer.
     * An all-new body that provides better ride and handling.

   The 2017 Armada will go on sale this summer at a time when gas prices
   are likely to still be low, which bodes well for the big SUV.

   While Nissan didn't release fuel economy figures for the new version,
   the outgoing model got a combined fuel economy of just 15 miles per
   gallon.

   Peter Luttenbacher, manager of product planning, declined to say what
   the 2017 version will get but said it will be better.

   The Armada is Nissan's largest and most powerful SUV. Its redesign
   comes on the heels of Nissan's redesigned Pathfinder, Murano and Rogue,
   which have all been launched over the past three years. It competes
   with SUVs like the Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Yukon, Toyota Sequoia and
   Toyota Land Cruiser.

   Miller estimates that the large SUV segment accounts for about 300,000
   in annual sales in the U.S.

   Last year, Nissan sold only 12,737 Armada's, or just 1.1% more than the
   prior year. But Miller said Nissan stopped producing the outgoing
   Armada about half-way through the year.

   Nissan, he said, is confident its new Armada will win over a larger
   share of families who need the space and comfort it is offering.

   Miller also declined to say how much the Armada will cost, but with all
   of the improvements and the investment into the new vehicle it could
   easily be a few thousand dollars higher than the current Armada, which
   starts at $38,510 — a bargain for the segment.

   "We are not looking at a big jump," Miller said. "We are still going to
   offer an affordable, full-size SUV."

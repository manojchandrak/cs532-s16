   Boris Johnson's wife has savaged[69] David Cameron's EU deal, writing a
   2,700-word essay explaining why it fails to address the core legal
   problems of Britain's membership of the 28-state bloc.

   In a damning assessment of the Prime Minister's proposals for reform,
   Marina Wheeler QC, a human rights lawyer, said they 'raise more
   questions than they answer'.

   And on the key issue of sovereignty - the most important area for Mr
   Johnson - she said the plan for a 'red card' for national parliaments
   to veto unwanted EU laws 'ducks the issue entirely'.

   the EU

   Wheeler's letter is a strong indication that her husband will back the
   Brexit campaign after months speculation.

   Accusing Cameron of ignoring the real problems of Britain's membership
   of the EU, she writes that 'proper reform' should address the way the
   EU enforces its legislation.

   She says the Prime Minister's renegotiation should have reviewed the
   jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, 'whose reach has
   extended to a point where the status quo is untenable'.

   The ECJ is 'eroding national sovereignty,' she writes, and also
   'undermines legal certainty' and 'good governance'.

   Wheeler leaves open the possibility of backing Cameron in the
   referendum but suggests she will only do so if he significantly
   broadens his demands for reform.

   'Now, when Britain is debating its relationship to the EU, we should
   state our position afresh,' she writes in an essay for the [75]Human
   Rights Blog.

   'Here is an opportunity to restore a measure of constitutional
   coherence. Let us not pass it by.'

   Wheeler's intervention will intensify speculation that Johnson will
   campaign for Brexit, which would deal a major blow to Cameron's hopes
   of keeping Britain in the EU.

   The Prime Minister promised Johnson that he will introduce plans in the
   coming days to 'put beyond doubt' the supremacy of the House of Commons
   over EU law after the London Mayor demanded assurances over British
   sovereignty.

   Friends of Johnson said he had given the Prime Minister a one-week
   deadline to come up with the proposals - before he travels to Brussels
   on February 18 for his crunch EU summit with his 27 fellow European
   leaders.

   He will hope to secure agreement on his renegotiation package at the
   summit before heading back to the UK for a four-month referendum
   campaign.

   But winning the backing of Johnson is seen as crucial and plans to
   bring in the 'sovereignty bill' is seen as a direct attempt to win over
   his support.

   By writing such a damning assessment of Cameron's renegotiation,
   however, Wheeler has again cast doubt over Johnson's stance on the
   referendum.

   She writes: 'Politically, the proposals may be just the job: a new
   commitment to enhance competitiveness, proposals to limit benefits to
   migrants, recognition that member states’ different aspirations for
   further integration must be respected, and creation of a ‘red card’
   mechanism to block EU legislation.

   'Legally, however, they raise more questions than they answer.'

   Wheeler adds: 'This ought to have been an opportunity to look at the
   Court of Justice of the European Union, whose reach has extended to a
   point where the status quo is untenable.

   'Aside from eroding national sovereignty (which it does) the current
   situation also undermines legal certainty — which, in turn, undermines
   good governance.

   'Proper reform needs to address the EU legal order, in particular the
   jurisdictional muscle-flexing of the Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

   'The new proposals do not do this. Instead, they duck the issue
   entirely — clearing the way for a whole new body of EU rights law.'

BORIS JOHNSON ACCUSES DAVID CAMERON OF 'NOT TRYING HARD ENOUGH' TO REGAIN
CONTROL OF BRITAIN'S BORDERS

   Boris Johnson warned that the current proposals for an 'emergency
   brake' were 'minor' tweaks to benefit rules and would not allow Britain
   to 'recapture' control of its borders, which are coming under
   increasing strain from thousands of migrants trying to cross the
   Channel from Calais, pictured above

   Boris Johnson warned that the current proposals for an 'emergency
   brake' were 'minor' tweaks to benefit rules and would not allow Britain
   to 'recapture' control of its borders, which are coming under
   increasing strain from thousands of migrants trying to cross the
   Channel from Calais, pictured above

   Boris Johnson has accused David Cameron of not trying hard enough to
   regain control of Britain's borders as speculation intensifies over
   which side of the EU campaign he will join.

   The Prime Minister hailed proposals for an 'emergency brake' on EU
   migrants' access to benefits as 'substantial change' when he unveiled
   his draft deal for Britain to remain in the EU last week.

   But the Mayor of London dismissed the changes as a 'minor' tweak to
   benefit rules.

   And he complained that the Government had accepted that freedom of
   movement was 'an age-old inviolable principle of the EU'.

   The Mayor of London said he would like to remain in the EU but insisted
   he would 'wait until you see the whites of their eyes' before making
   his decision.

   'This is not quite so,' he wrote in his Daily Telegraph column. 'Until
   recently it only applied to "workers" rather than all EU citizens.

   'Why didn't we try harder to recapture control of our borders, rather
   than stick at this minor (if worthwhile) change to the law on benefits?

   'There may be a good explanation, but we need to hear it.'

   Mr Johnson piled pressure on Cameron by adding:' Let's hope for some
   answers in the next fortnight.'

   But Downing Street responded to his comments by insisting Cameron had
   put a 'vast amount of time and effort' in securing concessions on
   migration and welfare.

   A spokesman for the Prime Minister said: 'At the start of it, people
   said there was "no point even trying to get these discussions, you
   wouldn't get anything from the EU, you wouldn't get any kind of change
   on migration or welfare, you wouldn't get an emergency brake, none of
   these things would happen".

   'Actually the Prime Minister has gone out, worked hard, he has
   negotiated and he's go to a point where we now have proposals on the
   table from Donald Tusk which address these core issues.'

       moving in a gender-equal world¿I had a sense of it, but I didn¿t
       start to really see evidence of it, I think, until I hit puberty.
       Media even before that age is already creating all these biases.
       \nDAVIS: And it¿s like, is this not the 21st century? I mean,
       really? But that isn¿t what made me do the research. I just started
       asking my friends if they had noticed. None of them¿feminists,
       mothers, daughters¿noticed until I pointed it out. Then I decided
       to bring it up within the industry. I knew a lot of people, so I¿d
       say, ¿Have you ever noticed how few female characters there are in
       kids movies?¿ when I met a director, a producer, whatever. And they
       said, ¿Oh, but that¿s not true anymore.¿ Then they would name a
       movie with one female character as the proof that things had
       changed. [Watson laughs] My point was the world is missing female
       characters. A lot of times 'I have so much experience!' Geena Davis

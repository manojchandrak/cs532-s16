[102]The Oral History Of The Weeknd's Beauty Behind The Madness
       The GRAMMYsHe caught the global music scene unawares, thumbing his
       nose at pop convention with a fearless fusion of brooding R&B and
       high-concept art rock. Within three years of his 2011 debut,
       Canadian singer/songwriter Abel Tesfaye, known as The Weeknd, had
       cultivated an underground following so loyal he headlined the
       world-famous Hollywood Bowl without ever having placed a Top 40
       U.S. single.So when fans learned in 2015 that their mysterious
       antihero was collaborating on a new album with renowned hit
       producers, including Max Martin and Savan Kotecha, it came as a
       shock.

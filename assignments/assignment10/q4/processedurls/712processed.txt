   INSIDE EDITION - A baby miraculously woke up in a Chinese morgue after
   spending 15 hours at just over 10 degrees Fahrenheit, according to
   reports.

   Morgue workers in Pan'an in the eastern province of Zhejiang were
   preparing to cremate the boy when he began to moan, AFP reports, citing
   provincial television.

   The boy had spent weeks in intensive care after being born prematurely
   in January.

   After 23 days, the boy's father took him home to celebrate the Lunar
   New Year.

   Days later, the boy's condition worsened and he was declared dead
   February 4. His doctor decided the boy's heart had stopped beating and
   a doctor issued a death certificate.

   But the boy wasn't dead.

   It's the first time I've seen this. It's a true miracle," said a doctor
   at the boy's Pan'an hospital.

   According to reports, the boy's father wrapped him in two layers of
   clothing and a thick bag before taking him to the morgue, possibly
   saving his life.

   However, the miracle may be short-lived. Doctors say they're cautious
   about his chances of recovery.

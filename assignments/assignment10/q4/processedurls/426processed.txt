   South Korea has released the first images of debris believed to be left
   over from a long-range rocket that North Korea launched into space on
   Sunday. According to Seoul, Pyongyang’s satellite has reached orbit and
   passes over South Korea four times a day.

   “The proportion of the long-range missile’s diameter and length is 2.4
   to 30, the same [as the previous rocket],” South Korea’s Defense
   Ministry said on Tuesday, referring to a Unha-3 rocket that the North
   previously launched in December of 2012. No debris was recovered from
   that liftoff.

   Seoul is now analyzing the pieces, which it found soon after North
   Korea announced that it had succeeded in placing the “newly developed
   earth observation satellite Kwangmyongsong-4” into orbit. Reports
   suggest that the North Korean satellite is now passing over South Korea
   four times a day, though it is still unclear whether it is sending
   signals and functioning properly, according to Yonhap news agency.

   “The locations where the first, second stages and the fairing landed
   are the same as those of Unha-3,” a Defense Ministry official was
   quoted by Yonhap as saying.

   A South Korean Aegis destroyer [34]spotted the rocket releasing its
   first stage into the Yellow Sea approximately two minutes after the
   alleged launch, and its fairing in waters southwest of Jeju Island –
   one of the region’s main tourist destinations – four minutes later.

   The Joint Chiefs of Staff said on Sunday that the first stage had
   “separated from [the rocket’s] main body and exploded into about 270
   pieces,” an indication that the rocket’s first-stage booster was fitted
   with a self-destruct device.

   Based on the results of recent simulations, the South believes the
   second stage may have fallen into the Pacific Ocean somewhere east of
   the Philippine island of Luzon, the news agency reported.

   After studying the [38]trajectory of the pieces, South Korean officials
   concluded that it was a long-range missile which had lifted off from
   North Korea’s northwest Dongchang-ri launch site on Sunday at 9:30 am
   local time (1 am GMT). It confirmed that the route matched that which
   the North had previously reported to the United Nations’ maritime and
   aviation agencies.

   Seoul has been accusing Pyongyang of disguising a long-range missile
   test as a peaceful space mission, while Pyongyang claimed before their
   latest launch that the satellite would monitor the weather and map the
   location of natural resources and forests.

   According to the South Korean Defense Ministry, Pyongyang is believed
   to possess a long-range missile with a maximum range of 12,000
   kilometers and the capacity to carry a payload weighing about 250
   kilograms.

   The Ministry has also confirmed that the satellite and the third stage
   are rotating in their orbits. The latter should soon lose its orbit and
   burn up. The North still does not have so-called “re-entry technology,”
   which is necessary to bring a ballistic missile fired into space back
   into the atmosphere, Yonhap cited an unnamed official as saying.

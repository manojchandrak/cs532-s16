Race car driver arrested in alleged $2 billion payday lending empire

   by [91]Jose Pagliery   [92]@Jose_Pagliery February 10, 2016: 6:37 PM ET

   scott tucker race showcase Scott Tucker has been charged in an alleged
   payday loan scam.

The Justice Department cracked down on two major payday lending empires
Wednesday, including one that belonged to race car driver Scott Tucker.

   Tucker is a 53-year-old financier who races Ferraris in professional
   competitions. He was arrested on Wednesday, accused of running an
   illegal $2 billion payday lending enterprise and hit with federal RICO
   charges.

   From 1997 until 2013, Tucker operated payday lending companies that
   gave 4.5 million Americans short-term, high-interest loans under
   "deceitful" circumstances, according to a federal indictment filed in
   New York City and unsealed Wednesday.

   Prosecutors say Tucker cut secret deals with a Native American tribe to
   make it seem like the tribe owned his companies, shielding him from
   state lawsuits and regulators.

   Tucker and his corporate lawyer, Timothy Muir, were both arrested in
   Kansas City, Kansas, on Wednesday, according to the FBI.

   Neither of their attorneys immediately responded to CNNMoney's requests
   for comment.

   Their enterprise, which included 600 employees, ran under names like
   Ameriloan, Cash Advance, One Click Cash, Preferred Cash Loans, United
   Cash Loans, U.S. FastCash, 500 FastCash, Advantage Cash Services and
   Star Cash Processing.

   Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said Tucker's "deceptive and
   predatory [enterprise]... has been exposed for what it is -- a criminal
   scheme."

   Here's how prosecutors claim it worked: Someone would borrow $500.
   Tucker's company would slap on a $150 "finance charge." In reality,
   borrowers ended up paying closer to $1,425 in fees and interest because
   Tucker's company structured the loan to prolong the payback. It
   automatically tapped into borrowers' bank accounts with every new
   paycheck -- but usually counted payments as entirely or mostly
   "interest."

   This payday lending operation caught the attention of state prosecutors
   across the country, according to federal officials. But state
   prosecutors had their hands tied. Company documents claimed the
   businesses were owned by the Miami Native American tribe of Oklahoma
   and protected by "sovereign immunity," which prevents states from suing
   tribes.

   Federal investigators say they were able to pressure the Miamis into
   making a deal. In legal papers, the tribe admitted that Tucker
   approached them to become business partners for a payday loan
   enterprise, shielding it from state investigations. The tribe agreed to
   give up $48 million in payday revenue, and in return, federal officials
   agreed not to prosecute tribe members.

   Tucker and his lawyer have been charged with unlawful debts, and
   violating the Truth in Lending Act and the Racketeer Influenced and
   Corrupt Organizations Act.

   Federal agents are confiscating Tucker's six Ferraris, four Porsches, a
   Learjet, his mansion property in Aspen, Colorado, and 27 bank accounts
   connected to Tucker's family and his attorney.

   Another payday lender, another take down

   In a separate case in nearby Kansas City, Missouri, the FBI on
   Wednesday arrested Richard Moseley Sr., accusing him of sitting atop a
   $161 million payday lending empire.

   Prosecutors describe Moseley's enterprise as an online scam that
   tricked people who didn't even ask for a loan.

   Since 2004, Moseley built a network of shell companies that
   "systematically exploited more than 620,000 financially disadvantaged,
   working people throughout the United States," according to a federal
   indictment filed in New York City.

   As described in the indictment: If a potential borrower merely wanted
   to check if she qualified for a $300 payday loan, Moseley's company
   would have her fill out a questionnaire and include her bank account
   information. But without warning, she would receive the money -- plus a
   $90 "finance charge."

   Every two weeks, the payday company would automatically tap into a
   borrower's bank account and pull out $90 without explanation. It was
   only the loan's interest, not capital. But consumers weren't told that,
   prosecutors allege.

   Here's where it got ugly. Each time, there was an "automatic renewal"
   of the original, still-unpaid $300 loan, according to the indictment.
   And Moseley's company would collect another $90 two weeks later.

   To give an idea of the operation's scale: During a 15-month period,
   Moseley's empire issued $97 million in payday loans and collected $115
   million in fees, according to federal financial regulators.

   Moseley appeared at a federal courtroom in Kansas City and has been
   released on bond, according to the Kansas City Star. His attorney said
   Moseley will plead not guilty.

   Moseley ran this enterprise under 20 companies with names like
   PiggyCash Online Holdings, DJR Group, SJ Partners and Rocky Oak
   Services. Many of them operated under the name Hydra, a reference to
   the multi-headed beast of Greek mythology.

   In the past, Moseley and his business partners had been sued by the
   Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for "running an illegal cash-grab
   scam." In 2014, a federal judge froze the companies' assets and ordered
   their websites shut down.

   According to the Justice Department, Moseley and his son pocketed at
   least $27 million over the years and bought "multiple luxury vehicles,"
   country club memberships, and vacation homes in Colorado and the
   Mexican coastal resort town Playa Del Carmen.

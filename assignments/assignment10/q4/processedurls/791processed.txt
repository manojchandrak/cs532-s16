Sanders Supports Strengthened Sanctions on North Korea

   Wednesday, February 10, 2016

   WASHINGTON, Feb. 10 – Sen. Bernie Sanders submitted the following
   statement in support of the North Korea Sanctions and Policy
   Enhancement Act of 2016 to the Congressional record today:

   “The totalitarian state of North Korea is becoming more belligerent by
   the day. In January, the country detonated its fourth nuclear bomb
   since 2006 – which the North Korean military claims was a small
   hydrogen bomb. Just last week, the country launched a rocket carrying a
   satellite into space, foreshadowing the possible development of a
   long-range ballistic missile capable of delivering a nuclear
   payload.  According to National Intelligence Director James Clapper,
   North Korea recently expanded a uranium enrichment facility and
   restarted a plutonium reactor that could start recovering material for
   nuclear weapons within months, or even weeks. I am deeply concerned by
   these actions.

   “We must exhaust every diplomatic option we have to pressure North
   Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program, halt its aggressive
   military posturing with South Korea and adhere to the tenets of
   international human rights law. That is why I strongly support the
   bipartisan effort to strengthen sanctions on the rogue North Korean
   regime.

   “These sanctions are an important tool in resolving the growing threat
   from Pyongyang.  The legislation before the Senate would help prevent
   North Korea from obtaining goods or technology related to nuclear
   weapons, ban foreign assistance to any country that provides lethal
   military equipment to North Korea, and target the country's trade in
   key industrial commodities. These steps are absolutely essential if we
   are to achieve our longstanding mission to end the North’s nuclear
   weapons program. Certainly, sanctions are far preferable to pre-emptive
   military force, which I strongly oppose.

   “In addition to sanctions, the U.S. must work with the few nations that
   have diplomatic and economic relationships with North Korea – namely
   China – to pressure Kim Jong-un to stop threatening the stability of
   the region and join the community of nations.  While China may have
   been a steadfast ally of North Korea’s in the past, China now has far
   more shared interests with the U.S. than with Pyongyang. It is time to
   make resolving the Korean peninsula conflict a top diplomatic goal in
   terms of our own relationship with China.

   “I am pleased to see that the sanctions bill includes a waiver to allow
   humanitarian organizations to deliver much needed relief to ordinary
   North Korean citizens, and authorizes $2 million for humanitarian
   assistance. Sanctions come at a cost, and we must do everything
   possible to make sure the North Korean people – who already suffer so
   much under Kim Jong-un – do not pay an even greater price. While I will
   be necessarily absent for the expected bipartisan passage of the bill,
   I strongly support the North Korea sanctions legislation.”

Carly Fiorina's status update: Out of White House race

   Former HP CEO Carly Fiorina's exit wasn't really a surprise.
   JIM LO SCALZO/epa/Corbis

   Carly Fiorina had some bad news to share. So, the Republican
   presidential candidate turned to everyone's favorite place to
   commiserate, Facebook.

   Fiorina, the former CEO and chairman of Hewlett-Packard, suspended her
   [111]bid for the White House on Wednesday after finishing seventh in
   the New Hampshire primary. She skipped a [112]major morning TV news
   outlet to deliver the news, instead posting a [113]statement to
   Facebook.

   For good measure, she also tweeted it out.

   "This campaign was always about citizenship -- taking back our country
   from a political class that only serves the big, the powerful, the
   wealthy, and the well connected," Fiorina wrote.

   Fiorina's exit wasn't really a surprise, and neither was the platform
   for her announcement. Both GOP and Democratic candidates are actively
   using social media to reach potential voters and have dedicated staff
   manning their Twitter and Facebook pages.

   The active use of Facebook and Twitter is part of the new political
   wisdom that winning on social media is part of winning at the ballot
   box. By that thinking, it's no wonder Fiorina dropped out.

   As of the beginning of February, Fiorina wasn't even close to cracking
   a million Twitter followers or Facebook likes. Republican front runner
   Donald Trump, by comparison, has[117] more than 5 million Twitter
   followers and Facebook likes.

   Fiorina was the only former technology executive in the race for the
   White House, but tales of her leadership at HP may have worried some
   voters and party leaders. Fiorina's controversial decision in 2001 to
   merge with PC maker Compaq led to a rift with the company's board and
   culminated in a [118]messy ouster in 2005. In 2010, Fiorina made a
   failed bid for a US Senate seat in California against incumbent Barbara
   Boxer. Fiorina's tenure at HP was heavily criticized during that race.

   During her presidential run, Fiorina played up her time at HP and tried
   to connect with women voters by focusing on her ability to lead in
   [119]male-dominated Silicon Valley.

   "To young girls and women across the country, I say: do not let others
   define you," she wrote in her parting note on Facebook. "Do not listen
   to anyone who says you have to vote a certain way or for a certain
   candidate because you're a woman."

   Like much of her campaign, Fiorina's exit was overshadowed by other
   candidates. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on Wednesday [120]also
   reportedly decided to drop out of the presidential race.

   It appears only Ohio Gov. John Kasich had time to wish her farewell.

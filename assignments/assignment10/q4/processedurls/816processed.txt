CRUZ: Today We Celebrate the Gifts God Has Bestowed on Us

   Commemorates Fat Tuesday and Ash Wednesday

   HOUSTON, Texas – Presidential candidate Ted Cruz today released the
   following statement on Fat Tuesday and in advance of Ash Wednesday:

   “Today Christians across the country celebrate Fat Tuesday in
   anticipation of the liturgical season of Lent. It is a day to enjoy the
   gifts God has given us on this earth – and to do so with joy and
   gratitude.

   “As we approach Ash Wednesday, many Christians practice the tradition
   of uniting with Christ’s fasting for 40 days in the desert, taking time
   to reflect on Christ’s ultimate gift to us – his sacrifice on the cross
   – and offering up something in their own lives in remembrance of his
   suffering. I hope that this season of Lent, especially during this Year
   of Mercy, brings much healing and reconciliation to all those who seek
   God with a humble heart. May it be a time for us to hold close to the
   promise of 2 Chronicles 7:14, ‘If My people who are called by My name
   will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their
   wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin
   and heal their land.’”

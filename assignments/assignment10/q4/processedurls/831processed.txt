   By [182]Andrew Blake - The Washington Times - Tuesday, February 9, 2016

   Islamic State supporters are using [183]Edward Snowden and his
   revelations about the [184]U.S. government’s surveillance capabilities
   to urge followers of the terror group to adopt digital security
   practices, including the use of strong encryption.

   Proponents of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, started
   circulating a propaganda video across the Internet in recent days which
   contains several clips from Citizenfour, the 2014 film about [185]Mr.
   Snowden and the [186]U.S. National Security Agency, along with advice
   for evading the [187]NSA’s eavesdropping abilities.
   [INS: :INS]

   Among the scenes from the Academy Award-winning documentary included in
   the 13-minute upload are clips in which the former government
   contractor describes the [188]NSA’s ability to gather digital
   communications anywhere on Earth; retired intelligence expert Bill
   Binney is also shown discussing mass data analysis, and Jacob
   Appelbaum, a journalist and activist, describes how the [189]NSA uses
   that information to make determinations about individuals based off of
   their interactions.

   “This is just a drop in the ocean,” reads an English-language
   translation of a title card that appears at the end of the video, as
   [191]reported first by Vocativ on Monday. “Our enemies are monitoring
   us day and night, collecting our information and targeting us. This is
   very dangerous. Carelessness and negligence in digital security cannot
   be tolerated.”

   The video, “The Electronic War And The Negligence Of The Supporters Of
   Mujahedeen,” concludes by directing viewers to a website, written in
   Arabic, which links to several articles and pages containing tutorials
   and information about digital security, encryption and the Islamic
   State. It’s credited to “Technical Islamic State” and appears to have
   been created last July, but likely could see a resurgence in readers
   with the recent boost online from pro-Islamic State groups.

   Vocativ reported that the video is the product of the Afaq Agency, “an
   ISIS-affiliated group focused on issues related to hacking and cyber
   security,” and was discovered using the website’s “deep web
   technology.” Isdarat, a site that hosts Islamic State propaganda on
   both the deep web and the more widely accessed “surface” web, began
   hosting the video on Saturday. The Vocativ article makes no mention of
   Isdarat, but claims the video was shared this week by the Afaq Agency’s
   account on Telegram, a social networking application popular among
   Islamic State supporters, and has since spread across social media.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Regardless of its origin, the video is making waves in the midst of a
   heated debate between lawmakers in Washington and the Silicon Valley
   tech sector with respect to regulating encryption. A national security
   discussion has intensified in recent weeks over whether or not Internet
   companies should be forced to decrypt digital communications for
   investigators that are otherwise protected by strong end-to-end
   encryption, and was among the main topics at a Senate Intelligence
   Committee hearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday.

   “I’m not sure we’ve exhausted all the possibilities here
   technologically,” Director of National Intelligence James Clapper
   testified while discussing solutions to the [193]government’s so-called
   “going dark” debacle. “I would hope that we have not yet exhausted what
   can be done voluntarily.”

   Several members of the Obama administration have blamed [194]Mr.
   Snowden in the past for allegedly having aided terrorists as a result
   of his unauthorized disclosures, including Chris Inglis, [195]NSA’s
   deputy director at the time the leaks were first reported.

   “Having disclosed all of those methods, or at least some degree of
   those methods, it would be impossible to imagine that, as intelligent
   as they are in the use of technology, in the employment of
   communications for their own purposes, it’s impossible to imagine that
   they wouldn’t understand how they might be at risk to intelligence
   services around the world, not the least of which is the U.S. And they
   necessarily do what they think is in their best interest to defend
   themselves,” Mr. Inglis previously told The Washington Times.

   Back in December of last year, Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige made a
   comment which certainly seemed to suggest that [35]Thanos was not going
   to be in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Feige said, “I wouldn't look
   too hard in [Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2] for Thanos.”

   Of course, with any Marvel Studios film, there are usually multiple
   drafts of the script, so things can always change in revisions.
   However, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 director James Gunn has now
   also confirmed there is no Thanos in the film, while elaborating on the
   reason why.

   In response to a fan on Facebook asking if there would actually be more
   Thanos in the sequel this past weekend, Gunn responded, “No. He's not
   in the film.” Gunn also added, “There's no sadness. I chose the story
   to tell in Vol. 2 because it's the story I wanted to tell! It just
   happens not to include Thanos. And I've answered honestly because I've
   answered it before.”

   Back in January, Gunn also confirmed that he had sent essentially
   the [36]final draft of the script to the cast, so it’s unlikely that
   there would be a revision to add Thanos at this point. Gunn and several
   cast members have even already started doing rehearsals in Atlanta, so
   other than the slight changes that can sometimes happen during
   shooting, the script appears to be pretty much set.

   Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 will be released in movie theaters on
   [37]May 5, 2017.

       Ragnarok and 2 Infinity War movies-we'll get our fix of the Mad
       Titan! Hard to be patient though, can't wait to see him in
       action-laying waste to some Avengers!!!

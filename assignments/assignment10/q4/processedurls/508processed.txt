Dressing according to the Royal fashion rules

   11 February 2016 Last updated at 00:13 GMT

   The women of the Royal Family have often been looked to as leaders of
   fashion taste. Yet the way they dress can be constrained by their royal
   duties.

   A new exhibition at Kensington Palace looks at this delicate balance
   through the wardrobes of Queen Elizabeth II, Princess Margaret and
   Diana, Princess of Wales.

   Libby Thompson, curator at Historic Royal Palaces, talks about some of
   dresses in the exhibition.

   Fashion Rules Restyled opens at Kensington Palace on 11 February

   Video produced by Sylvia Smith and Richard Duebel

   King County prosecutors recently charged a man with the violent rape of
   a Federal Way woman.

   David Tyrone Hoston, 29, is being held on a $500,000 bail at the
   Regional Justice Center in Kent. He is charged with two counts of
   second-degree assault, one count of first-degree rape and one count of
   first-degree burglary, all of which have a a domestic violence
   provision tacked on. Hoston is also facing one count of attempting to
   elude a pursuing police vehicle, for a total of five counts.

   Federal Way police arrested Hoston Jan. 31 after an acquaintance he was
   staying with tipped off his location.

   According to charging documents, prosecutors believe Hoston broke into
   a woman’s Federal Way apartment in the 1900 block SW Campus Drive in
   the early hours of Jan. 31.

   The woman awoke to being strangled and beaten. The suspect’s gloved
   hands squeezed her neck, causing her to lose consciousness. When she
   regained consciousness, she realized the suspect was attempting to rape
   her. She begged him to stop, calling him by name when she recognized
   his black sweatshirt as belonging to someone she knew.

   Her pleas went unanswered, and the suspect raped her. After he was
   done, he sat on the floor of the woman’s bedroom, questioning what he
   did and stating that he could have killed the victim.

   He went to get her a bowl of cereal and some water and told her she
   should go to the hospital, but the woman assured him it would be OK and
   advised him to lock the back door, which he admitted to prying open,
   and go out the front door.

   After he left, the woman immediately called police, who found him in
   the apartment complex at 3:40 a.m.

   Officers attempted to arrest the suspect, who got into his vehicle and
   fled before abandoning it near another apartment building and running
   away.

   Later that day, at about 1:30 p.m., police received a call from the
   suspect’s friend stating that the suspect was at his house.

   Hoston is also being charged with strangling the woman in November
   2015. After the two had an argument about the victim using the
   suspect’s cell phone to call her children, he allegedly strangled her,
   causing her to lose consciousness in the apartment parking lot. She was
   able to get away and call police, who documented her injuries.

   It appears Hoston has a history of similar abuse.

   Charging documents state Hoston strangled a different woman, the mother
   of one of his other children, last year. That victim reported prior
   assaults and had filed two protection order petitions in August and
   September of 2015. Hoston’s record also shows a completed deferred
   sentence on two counts of fourth-degree assault from 2010.

   Harford Co. Sheriff Jeffrey R. Gahler says he believes suspect in
   deaths of two deputies was targeting police.

   Two longtime Harford County sheriff's deputies were shot to death in
   broad daylight Wednesday at a busy shopping center by a man officials
   believe was targeting police, according to authorities.

   The 68-year-old suspect, whom officials described as a vagrant, was
   also killed in the confrontation in Abingdon, a closely knit community
   30 miles northeast of Baltimore.

   The mayhem erupted at a Panera Bread restaurant shortly before noon in
   the Boulevard at Box Hill shopping center.

   Officials declined to name the two deputies who were killed. Sheriff
   Jeffrey R. Gahler said one had served on the force for 30 years and was
   assigned to the courts services division, and the other had served for
   16 years and was assigned to the community services division.

   Less than a day after two Harford County Sheriff's Officers were killed

   in the line of duty, some questions remain about what transpired in a
   two-scene shooting in Abingdon.

   "Today is a sad day for the Harford County sheriff's office and the
   citizens of Harford County, who we are sworn to serve," Gahler told
   reporters Wednesday afternoon, and bowed his head. "It is with great
   sadness that I tell you both deputies who were shot earlier today have
   succumbed to their injuries."

   The suspect was identified as David Brian Evans. Gahler said there were
   two warrants for Evans' arrest — a criminal warrant for allegedly
   assaulting a police officer in Florida and a civil warrant issued in
   Harford County.

   Gahler said he believed Evans targeted one of the deputies inside the
   Panera "because he was in a police uniform."

   The deputies are believed to be the first in Harford to be killed by
   gunfire on duty in more than a century.

   The incident Wednesday was the first time in almost 15 years that two
   Maryland law enforcement officers were killed in a single shooting.

   Two Prince George's County sheriff's deputies were shot and killed in a
   2002 incident. Two officers were shot to death in 2001 in a trailer
   park in Centreville on the Eastern Shore.

   In Abingdon on Wednesday, deputies scoured multiple crime scenes for
   evidence hours after the shooting.

   The incident took about 15 minutes, officials said. It began when a
   deputy was shot in the head inside the restaurant in the 3400 block of
   Merchant Blvd. about 11:45 a.m., officials said.

   Gahler said the deputy was responding to a call from the restaurant. He
   said he was unsure of the nature of the call.

   After shooting the deputy, the gunman fled the restaurant, officials
   said. Witnesses pointed other deputies toward the Park View apartments,
   a senior living complex next to the shopping center on Box Hill South
   Parkway.

   A deputy found the suspect outside the complex, officials said. Both
   the suspect and a deputy were shot.

   One of the wounded deputies was taken to University of Maryland Upper
   Chesapeake Medical Center in Bel Air. The other was flown to the
   Maryland Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore.

   Gahler said he met with the families of both.

   "Obviously, I don't think I have to tell anybody, there are no words to
   describe what they're going through right now," he said.

   He said he knew the deputies well, and called them "outstanding" law
   enforcement officers.

   Gahler said two other officers fired weapons at the scene. Both have
   been placed on administrative leave.

   He said the investigation remains in the preliminary stages.

   "We fully suspect that both deputies were shot by the same suspect,"
   Gahler said. "We are not looking at anyone else. We believe it's an
   individual who's no longer a threat to the community."

   No customers inside the Panera were injured.

   Evans had an open criminal case in Florida for an alleged
   reckless-driving incident, according to online court records. The
   incident was alleged to have occurred last April. Evans then didn't
   show up for a court date.

   Harford County Executive Barry Glassman said Evans was an "outsider,"
   not a member of the community.

   "What little we know of the suspect is that it looks like he was
   somewhat of a vagrant, someone who moved around a lot," Glassman said.
   "Whether you're serving a summons or warrant, a guy like that, who has
   a pistol on his body in a public place and is willing to go outside and
   shoot an officer, is a risk to all us."

   Glassman said the two deputies showed "selfless dedication." He ordered
   Harford County flags to be lowered to half-staff.

   "We are grateful that these deputies did give the ultimate sacrifice
   for all of us," he said. "We also want to celebrate, with their
   families, their lives and their dedication to service."

   Gov. [15]Larry Hogan called their deaths "nothing less than absolutely
   heartbreaking."

   "The first lady and I send our most sincere thoughts and prayers to the
   families and loved ones of the brave deputies who made theultimate
   sacrifice today for the community they selflessly served," Hogan said
   in a statement. "It is my hope that their commitment and dedication to
   law enforcement and protecting otherswill be remembered and will
   forever serve as an inspiration to others."

   He said state police were working closely with Harford County as
   needed.

   A spokeswoman for Panera said the restaurant would remain closed during
   the investigation.

   "Our thoughts and actions now are directed towards the victims and
   their families," the company said in a statement.

   Former Harford County Sheriff L. Jesse Bane said he listened to the
   incident unfold on police radio.

   The deaths will strike the department hard, he said, because law
   enforcement officers form tight bonds.

   "You become part of a family," said Bane, the current town
   administrator in Bel Air. "That's what makes these things very
   difficult for law enforcement agencies to deal with."

   "We've lost two brothers," he said.

   Law enforcement in Harford County has suffered a series of losses in
   recent years.

   The sheriff's office, composed of roughly 300 sworn officers, suffered
   the back-to-back deaths in September 2012 of Cpl. Charles Barton Licato
   and Sgt. Ian A. Loughran.

   Licato, 34, was killed in an early-morning crash along U.S. 1 near the
   Conowingo Dam. His car left the road, slid down an embankment, and hit
   a pole and two trees before catching fire in a ravine.

   Loughran, 43, had mentored Licato. He suffered a heart attack at
   Licato's funeral.

   Also that month, the nearby Aberdeen Police Department endured the loss
   of Officer Charles N. Armetta, 29, who fell 47 feet to his death in an
   off-duty accident, and veteran Detective Mark A. Franklin, 55, who died
   of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

   These beautiful portraits reveal the incredibly human-like expressions
   of a variety of apes, showing how closely related we truly are.

   The intimate photographs show a wide range of monkey species, including
   bonobos, gorillas, orangutans and chimps, looking angry, sad, delighted
   and pensive.

   The many apes were photographed predominantly at zoos across Austria,
   Belgium, the Czech Republic, [69]Germany and the Netherlands.

   They are the works of Manuela Kulpa, from Cologne, Germany, who spent
   years photographing the animals.

   Ms Kulpa, 45, said: 'Emotions like our own are mirrored in the faces of
   the apes - you really can believe what you see in their faces.

   'They are happy, tender, mischievous, insulted, thoughtful, angry,
   helpless, shy, bashful, sad and so on.

   'In their eyes - if they grant us to take a deep look - you can find an
   odd mix of youth and age, light-heartedness and deep wisdom.

   'What is it that they know and we don't?'

   Ms Kulpa shot the unique series over a number of years, but only
   recently released the images to tie in with the Chinese New Year, the
   Year of the Monkey.

   The photographer has been shooting with her husband, Stefan, for the
   past eight years, and admits she has always been fascinated by
   wildlife.

   As well as her ape project, Ms Kulpa has worked on shoots with the
   likes of birds, dogs, big cats and elephants.

   Her favourite animals to shoot are simians and big cats, and through
   such images she hopes to show viewers the importance and beauty of
   nature.

   She added: 'My love for animals has grown very much over the years
   through photography.

     * [306]GEENA DAVIS INTERVIEWED BY EMMA WATSON\nOn realizing the
       gender disparity in media:\nWATSON: I didn¿t realize that I wasn¿t
       moving in a gender-equal world¿I had a sense of it, but I didn¿t
       start to really see evidence of it, I think, until I hit puberty.
       Media even before that age is already creating all these biases.
       \nDAVIS: And it¿s like, is this not the 21st century? I mean,
       really? But that isn¿t what made me do the research. I just started
       asking my friends if they had noticed. None of them¿feminists,
       mothers, daughters¿noticed until I pointed it out. Then I decided
       to bring it up within the industry. I knew a lot of people, so I¿d
       say, ¿Have you ever noticed how few female characters there are in
       kids movies?¿ when I met a director, a producer, whatever. And they
       said, ¿Oh, but that¿s not true anymore.¿ Then they would name a
       movie with one female character as the proof that things had
       changed. [Watson laughs] My point was the world is missing female
       characters. A lot of times 'I have so much experience!' Geena Davis

     * [309]West Hollywood, CA - Hailey Baldwin stops by Verve to grab
       some coffee. The 19-year-old model has what appears to be a cupping
       mark on her chest. Cupping is ancient form of alternative medicine
       in which a local suction is created on the skin. Hailey shows off
       her flat stomach wearing leggings and a pink crop top paired with
       white sneakers and an athletic jacket. \n \n AKM-GSI April 27,

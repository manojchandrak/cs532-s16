   Longtime Towson University diving coach Maureen Mead gets probation for
   recording team members in locker room.

   The former diving coach at [7]Towson University pleaded guilty
   Wednesday to placing a cellphone in a locker room and secretly
   recording members of a team that once considered her to be a "second
   mom."

   Maureen Mead, 43, received three years of probation before judgment,
   which would allow her record to eventually be cleared if she meets all
   conditions.

   In a plea agreement with prosecutors, Mead pleaded guilty in Baltimore
   County Circuit Court to visual surveillance — also known as "peeping
   Tom" — and altering physical evidence in connection to the October
   incident. Prosecutors dropped a felony wiretap charge.

   Mead, who was fired, is married to former Towson head swimming coach
   Pat Mead, who resigned in December.

   Dozens of swim team members and some of their parents filled the
   courtroom as a county prosecutor offered the first public account of
   what happened, saying the team's coaching staff at the time believed
   the women's team members were "talking bad" about the program and
   sabotaging recruitment efforts.

   Prosecutor Lisa Dever told Circuit Judge Jan Marshall Alexander that
   the day before the phone was discovered, there had been a meeting to
   resolve issues on the team, including disputes between upperclassmen
   and freshmen and comments exchanged on social media.

   About 7:30 a.m. on Oct. 16, several women in the locker room saw a
   light shining off the back of Maureen Mead's locker, Dever said. They
   went to check it out and found an iPhone propped up on a shampoo bottle
   and partially covered by a knit cap. Only members of the team have
   access to the room, and the lockers have no doors on them.

   As reporters and parents pressed [10]Towson University for details
   about a phone that was discovered recording swim team members in a pool
   locker room in October, campus officials focused on limiting the flow
   of information, according to emails reviewed by The Baltimore Sun.

   A 19-year-old team member picked up the phone and saw that it was
   recording. She watched a short portion, seeing two teammates getting
   undressed. Other women in the locker room ran out and told an assistant
   coach, who gave the phone back to Maureen Mead.

   Mead said she had lost her phone and "was so glad" the team found it,
   Dever said.

   No one from the coaching staff called police, Dever said. It was not
   until a team member's mother called a dean at the school that Towson
   University campus police were called to investigate — about four hours
   after the phone was found.

   By the time police seized the phone, it had been "factory reset," Dever
   said — with all information erased.

   Two days later, Pat Mead called assistant coach Adrienne Phillips, met
   her off school grounds and told her she should reset her phone, Dever
   said. He also told her that he and his wife had reset their phones and
   iPads.

   Dever said the women did not believe their coach's intent was to record
   them getting undressed, but rather to spy on them talking. Team members
   had even joked before that they thought they were being recorded
   because the Meads knew things from private conversations.

   Dever argued for a three-year suspended sentence, saying the swimmers
   had suffered a betrayal of trust that was "heart-wrenching." The
   coaching staff downplayed the incident, making the women feel worse,
   she said.

   "They dedicate everything — their heart and their soul goes into it,"
   Dever said of the swimmers. "They would've walked the ends of the earth
   for their coaches."

   Alexander heard emotional testimony from seven women who described how
   Maureen Mead's actions affected them. Some said Mead had once felt like
   a "second mom."

   The betrayal of trust shook their sense of identity, they said. One
   woman said she felt sick to her stomach going to the pool after the
   phone incident. Several women described feeling paranoid about being
   recorded in the locker room, once considered a private place.

   Mead, a former teacher, briefly addressed the court and apologized. A
   mother of four, she said she has lost her reputation and career. She
   also wished the women luck in their future swimming careers.

   "I never intentionally would hurt any of them," she said.

   She has struggled to find a new job because of the charges, defense
   attorney David Irwin said. USA Swimming, the sport's governing body,
   filed administrative charges against her, Irwin said.

   "The Meads have been punished," said Irwin, urging the judge to grant
   probation before judgment.

   Alexander said Maureen Mead's actions appeared to be an "act of
   desperation."

   "It's just wrong on so many levels," he said.

   He ordered her not to have contact with the victims, to stay away from
   the Towson campus, and not to coach "at any level" during her
   probation.

   Some women who addressed the media after the hearing said they were
   disappointed with the punishment and with their former coach's comments
   in the courtroom.

   "There was no real apology," said Hannah Snyder, a senior. "There was
   just a 'Good luck with the rest of your life.' … We just expected a
   little more."

   In a statement, Towson spokesman Ray Feldmann said school officials
   "respect the judicial system and the process that took place today."

   "This is a difficult situation and we will continue to provide support
   for our student-athletes," he said.

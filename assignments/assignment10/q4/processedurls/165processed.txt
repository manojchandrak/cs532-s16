     SOUTHBOROUGH — A local builder is looking to bring over-55 housing
     to the corner of Southville and Parkerville roads.

     The plan by Bartolini Builders of Southborough calls for 12 units,
     four standalone and four duplexes. The development will be called
     Cain's Crossing at Lincoln Square, according to the plans.

     The three different parcels to be used make up about five acres,
     according to the application.

     "The proposed driveway (of) Cain's Crossing will connect to
     Parkerville Road," wrote Walter Lewinski of Engineering Design
     Consultants, Inc. for Bartolini Builders. "The driveway provides
     access for eight buildings consisting of 12 dwelling units."

     Bartolini Builders is seeking a special permit from the Zoning Board
     of Appeals to proceed with the project. A public hearing will be
     held on Feb. 24 at 7:30 p.m. at Town Hall, 17 Common St.

     Mark Robidoux, the town's building commissioner and zoning officer,
     said the properties are located in the RB residences district. He
     said under the town bylaws the builder would have to seek a special
     permit to build the elderly multi-family units "within a major
     residential development."

     "At this time, I must deny your request for a building permit," he
     wrote in a letter on Jan. 13. "To proceed with this project,
     specific zoning relief in the form of a special permit must be
     granted by the Zoning Board."

     Under the bylaw, each unit is not allowed to have more than three
     bedrooms. The buildings are required to be consistent with homes in
     the area.

     The bylaw also encourages pedestrian connections to local services
     and maximizes the preservation of the natural features of the site
     through the use of cluster housing.

     The plans show the eight buildings clustered in a circle.

     Robidoux said the company will also need a special permit from the
     Planning Board.

     A septic system will be used by all the units, according to the
     plans.

   Today [23]Chance the Rapper took to Twitter to ask his followers a
   simple question: what are the three best songs on [24]Kanye
   West’s College Dropout album?

   He didn’t give them much time to answer before providing his own
   answers: “All Falls Down,” “Family Business,” and “We Don’t Care” are
   his personal favorites.

     Best 3 songs on College Dropout?

     — Chance The Rapper (@chancetherapper) [25]February 10, 2016

     Me personally… All Falls Down, Family Business, We Don't Care

     — Chance The Rapper (@chancetherapper) [26]February 10, 2016

   When Acid Rap came out in 2013, the opening song [27]“Good Ass Intro”
   was recognized as having a strong Kanye influence. With its partial
   gospel flavor combined with some juke rhythms, “Good Ass Intro” might
   have even been a prescient sign of the music to come from Yeezy, since
   he’s calling his new LP a “gospel” album.

   Chance and Kanye have been spotted in the studio before and Big Boy
   teased Chance’s name when he [28]snapped the first pic of Kanye’s
   notepad in the studio. At the top of the year [29]Chance also joked
   about artists finding out they aren’t on the new Yeezy album.

   Anyone who’s seen Chance the Rapper perform live might have been able
   to guess that “Family Business” is one of his favorite cuts
   from College Dropout; in 2015 he premiered a live cover version of the
   track at the Summer’s End Music Festival in Arizona, followed by a
   [30]studio version of the song with an accompanying video clip.

   Whether Chance the Rapper will be on Kanye West’s upcoming album
   remains to be seen, but it’d be a bit of a disappointment if he’s not.
   The trajectory of his past work meshes well with Kanye’s experimental
   style, so it’d make a lot of sense to see these two Chitown natives
   collaborate.

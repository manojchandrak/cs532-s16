Talking Turkey: a groundbreaking chat on LGBTI parenting

LGBTI parenting is on the rise and an upcoming panel discussion will cover
the ins and outs of the issue as part of Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras'
Queer Thinking series.

   A FEW years ago if you had suggested to Brydon Wang he would settle
   down with his boyfriend to get married, let alone becoming fathers to a
   gorgeous baby boy, he would have laughed at you.

   “About five years into the relationship, my partner suggested that we
   might eventually have a family. At the time, I baulked at the
   suggestion,” Wang said.

   “He proposed… in a complete surprise (to myself). I said yes – likely
   because he used the dogs in the proposal.”

   Wang married Nic in 2012 and it was on their honeymoon not long after
   the couple decided to start a family.

   A year after tying the knot, Wang went to a surrogacy conference in
   Melbourne to find out more about the process.

   The process from finding a surrogate to having a child was fairly quick
   for the couple, taking a year in total. Six months ago their son Dylan
   was born.

   “The moment I held my son in my hands, there was this certainty that
   this was the role I was born to play,” Wang said.

   “I felt instantly connected to where I came from and where I’m going
   and the role I play in all of this. And it’s an incredible feeling of
   completeness.”

   Wang will be one of five speakers on a panel called Talking
   Turkey hosted by Sydney’s Inner City Legal Centre (ICLC) about LGBTI
   parenting and conception. The forum as part of the Queer Thinking
   series in this year’s Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras festival.

   About 11 per cent of Australian gay men and 33 per cent of lesbians
   have dependent children – a number which could rise if NSW were to see
   changes such as the legalisation of commercial surrogacy.

   Wang thinks it’s important to share his experience.

   “It makes sense for me and my family to encourage other lesbian and gay
   couples to start a family,” he said.

   “The more we see families like our own, the more we’ll become part of
   the narrative of Australian culture and it’ll make it so much easier
   for our children as they grow up and find their place in the world.”

   The panel will be moderated by ICLC board director Moo Baulch and will
   include Professor Jenni Millbank, lawyer Michael Tiyce and Wang. It
   will cover topics such as sperm and egg donors, surrogacy and
   co-parenting.

   ICLC director Vicki Harding said the panel would be an important part
   of the Mardi Gras celebrations and give both personal and informative
   perspectives in an important and sometimes overlooked area of LGBTI
   experiences.

   “There are lots of misconceptions, legal pitfalls and bureaucratic
   machinations to be aware of,” she said.

   “LGBTIQ people looking to parent should not pass up this opportunity to
   learn about the ins and outs of this wonderful and complex process.”

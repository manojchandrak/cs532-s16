Chicago Tribune editor to speak on media transitions

   [175]Gerould Kern, senior vice president and editor of the Chicago
   Tribune and journalism alumnus, will talk about audience receptions and
   journalistic practices in the digital era of newspapers at 7 p.m. Feb
   10 in the Ernie Pyle Hall auditorium.

   Kern’s talk, “Does Mission Matter? Journalism on the Digital Front
   Line,” is the second of the school’s spring [176]Speaker Series. It is
   free and open to the public.

   Kern said in a phone interview that the topic of his talk is relevant
   not only to students looking to soon enter the newsroom professionally,
   but to anyone who consumes news.

   “Newspapers are transforming into primarily digital news mediums, and
   with the rise of digital, the pace of information is incredible,” said
   Kern. “It’s important to take note of how journalistic practices are
   changing and how audiences are reacting.”

   As editor of the Tribune, Kern has developed the paper’s digital
   platforms, expanded the Tribune’s opinion and commentary content, and
   established [177]Trib Nation, a series of live events that connect
   audiences with Tribune journalists. Under Kern’s leadership, the
   Tribune has been a Pulitzer finalist nine times since 2009 and won the
   prize for commentary.

   Kern, who has filled several leadership roles since he joined the
   Tribune in 1991, said people are well aware that newspapers are
   overcoming big challenges in an ever-changing industry. Few people are
   aware, however, of the creative solutions leaders in the industry are
   using to overcome these challenges.

   “Learning audience responses to digital content actually validates
   journalism and highlights where changes and improvements can be made,”
   he said. “I am going to address problems that we are facing in the
   newsroom right now and offer insights about data driven solutions.”

   Regardless of actions newspapers take to cope with the challenges they
   face, the role that journalism plays in citizen’s lives will always be
   an essential one, Kern said.

   “The business model of journalism may be changing but the needs it
   serves remains the same,” he said. “People need to know who’s trying to
   influence them, how to be safe, who to vote for. The need for
   journalism is greater now than it has been in recent past, and it has a
   real future as long as it continues to identify and serve those needs.”

   Kern, BA’71, said he is excited to return to the school that taught him
   why journalism is pivotal to a productive society.

   “IU is where I learned to be a reporter, what the journalistic mission
   is and all the good things journalism does,” said Kern. “I’ve carried
   these lessons with me through my career, so it’s great to be able to
   come back with a report from the front lines.”

   Kern is the school’s Roy W. Howard Lecturer this semester.

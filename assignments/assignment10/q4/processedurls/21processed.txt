28 Burning Questions About ‘Harry Potter And The Cursed Child’

   Seriously, we're burning up like dying phoenixes over here.
   by [8]Victoria McNally 10/23/2015

   Today we finally learned some more tantalizing details about “[9]Harry
   Potter and the Cursed Child,” the two-part play J.K. Rowling will bring
   to London next year. And yep, it’s not a prequel — instead it’s a
   sequel about Harry’s life after Hogwarts and how he relates to his
   angst-ridden son, Albus Severus Potter.

   But that’s not enough! We must know more, especially since so few of us
   are actually going to to be able to see it ourselves when it comes to
   West End in summer 2016. Here are all the questions we have about what
   to expect from the wizarding world, 19 years (well, four years if we’re
   talking real life) after we last left Harry and his friends.
    1.

Who is the cursed child?
       tumblr_luplo1jUFZ1qfshva
       Warner Bros.
       Presumably it has to be Albus Severus Potter, Harry Potter’s
       youngest son. Why else would they mention him?
    2.

If Albus is the cursed child, is it a real curse or a metaphorical one?
       tumblr_lupll8ogXl1qfshva
       Warner Bros.
       Is he just stressed out about having to live up to his family name,
       or did somebody cast a bat-bogey hex on his face or something?
    3.

Also, does he have to live in a snitch nest now?
       CSAhUK4UYAAFqp2
       Seriously, what up, Albus. You can come out, it’s all cool.
    4.

Does this mean Harry Potter is a bad father?
       anigif_mobile-31420-1441131897-10
       Warner Bros.
       Say it ain’t so!
    5.

Actually, what if he had to raise the kids all by himself?
       ginny
       Ginny was a very important former Quidditch player, after all, so
       she was probably on the road a lot before she joined up with The
       Daily Prophet. And it’s not like Harry has a whole lot of
       experience with positive family role models in his own childhood…
    6.

What about the rest of Harry’s kids, what are they up to right now?
       Harry Potter Epilogue Scene
       Warner Bros.
       Are they well adjusted? Eating right? How come Albus is the only
       one who’s got big enough problems to get a play about himself? It’s
       a middle child thing, isn’t it?
    7.

Will the play technically ever flash back to the time before the “Harry
Potter and the Deathly Hallows” epilogue?
       tumblr_nrlce3wIcR1sghygwo1_500
       Warner Bros.
       The official description doesn’t say!
    8.

Will it take place in more than one room?
       hogwarts-17
       We are here for some gorgeous theater sets, y’all.
    9.

What events in the past nineteen years have been influenced by magic that we
don’t even know about?
       Harry Potter GIF
       [10]Warner Bros.
       Like, did magic get Kate Middleton engaged? Probably, right? She is
       an enchantress.
   10.

Will we see young Albus at Hogwarts?
       tumblr_loecv8Q0DT1qdbbcoo1_500
       Warner Bros.
       YES PLEASE.
   11.

Will he get bullied like Harry was?
       draco sorting
       I sure hope not, but you never know. Kids are the worst.
   12.

Has another dark wizard risen?
       voldemortdies
       Warner Bros.
       There’s always a few skulking about, after all.
   13.

Who else from the original books will return?
       Ron Hermione Hospital
       Ginny, we’re guessing, but what about Ron, Hermione, and the rest
       of the Weasley clan? Will we see Draco Malfoy?
   14.

Will any of the actors from the movie franchise return to reprise their
roles?
       Hermiones_Patronus
       [11]Warner Brothers Pictures
       Hey, you never know. DanRad does love the theater now.
   15.

Do wizards have social media now?
       Harry Potter I love Magic GIF
       Warner Bros.
       What does the wizarding social media network look like? Is it
       called Floo-book?
   16.

Has the wizarding world embraced synthetic wand-making technology in the past
nineteen years?
       Harry Potter Breaks his Wand GIF
       Warner Bros.
       Just saying, if Ron’s wand had been made of plastic it would have
       been a lot sturdier.
   17.

Will we get to see any house elves?
       Dobby is free
       Warner Bros.
       We’re betting Harry would find an elf to pay and make part of the
       family if that’s the case. But how would they bring them to life?
       Puppets? a Tupac-style hologram?
   18.

What about other magical creatures, will we get to see those?
       harry hedwig
       Warner Bros.
       Does Harry have a new family owl now? *sob*
   19.

Where do Harry and his family even live?
       hogwartsexpress
       Warner Bros.
       Are they in London as well, or do they live out in the country? Are
       they among muggles or is there a seperate wizarding community for
       them?
   20.

What’s Harry’s job at the ministry like?
       Harry-Potter-Disgusted-Gif
       He’s described as “overworked” in the play’s new description, so
       that’s probably not good.
   21.

Does he miss the good ol’ days when he used to save the world from Voldemort
on the regular?
       tumblr_lxtqusyZLW1qe3p9bo1_500
       NBC
       I bet it’s just like that “Saturday Night Live” sketch where he
       wanders around Hogwarts talking about how he used to own this
       school.
   22.

Does he have his own chocolate frog card?
       a64f9fc4ce60fe1b563adf2d037fa71e.400x279x13
       Warner Bros.
       That’s probably upsetting for Albus, given he’s cursed and all.
   23.

Will the play address how Harry was probably never taught math?
       41398-Harry-Potter-shrug-gif-m0tK
       Warner Bros.
       Being an adult without knowing how to do income taxes is hard.
   24.

How hard was it for J.K. Rowling not to blurt out “NO IT’S A SEQUEL” anytime
someone asked her if “The Cursed Child” is a prequel?
       J.K Rowling - In Conversation
       Getty Images
       Probably very, right?
   25.

How will us non-Londonians get to see it?
       give_it_to_me_stephen_colbert
       Comedy Central
       Will they record a performance so we can get DVDs and watch it
       forever and ever again on a constant loop along with the rest of
       our “Harry Potter” movies? Or will we have to be there in person?
       It’s possible, but it might be tough.
   26.

Do we seriously have to worry about Harry being unlikeable in adulthood?
       harry-potter24-1433363377
       We’re assuming not given how much J.K. loves him, but after losing
       Atticus Finch as a role model earlier this year, you can see why
       some readers might be nervous.
   27.

And do we actually have to worry about anybody’s marriages?
       hermione-ron
       Warner Bros
       Will J.K. Rowling use this opportunity to break Ron and Hermione
       up, for example? Or is that just our inner Rita Skeeter talking?
   28.

Does this mean Rowling will never do a book sequel?
       harry potter letters
       Warner Brothers
       Let’s be real, probably not.

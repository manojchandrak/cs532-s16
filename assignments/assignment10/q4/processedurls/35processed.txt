   Fox News Is Plummeting As Trump Win Tears The Network Apart

   Fox News is becoming a network at war with itself as Megyn Kelly and
   Bill O’Reilly are in a personal feud, and Donald Trump’s victory is
   splitting the network into divided factions.

   [35]New York Magazine spoke to Fox News insiders and things aren’t
   looking good:
   Inside Fox there is confusion about what role the network should play
   in this altered media ecosystem going forward. According to three
   insiders I spoke to, the channel’s hosts and producers are split over
   how to cover Trump. Historically, in moments like this, the strategy
   would be clear: Punish the person who publicly crosses Fox. But network
   boss Ailes has tried that, and Trump not only survived the PR assaults,
   including one last month, but he seems to have emerged stronger than
   ever. The situation is even more dire because Marco Rubio, a favorite
   of many high-profile voices at the network, fared badly in the New
   Hampshire primary, only a few days after political analysts were
   floating the possibility that he might even beat Trump. Tuesday night,
   Fox’s pundit class had to accept that his robotic performance during
   ABC’s debate may have destroyed his candidacy. Charles Krauthammer even
   compared it to Ed Muskie’s 1972 implosion.

   ….

   In fact, Ailes’s bigger problem this week is not Trump. It’s figuring
   out how to broker peace between Fox’s biggest stars, Bill O’Reilly and
   Megyn Kelly. According to sources, the prime-time hosts are at war, in
   part over Kelly’s Trump-fueled stardom.

   It is no surprise that the network is supporting Rubio.[36] On-air
   talent looked suicidal after the Florida senator imploded at the New
   Hampshire Republican debate. It is also not a shock that Kelly and
   O’Reilly are at war with each other. O’Reilly may be the ratings king
   right now, but the network is making Megyn Kelly their star of the
   future.

   Donald Trump is helping to bring down Fox News. Ratings and profits
   will remain high because Fox News has cornered the market on
   conservative news consumers. They have no competition, so until
   demographics take their toll, Fox will continue to be on top.

   The biggest threat to Fox News is internal. Donald Trump has broken the
   Republican propaganda machine. There is no unified message coming out
   Fox’s programming. Roger Ailes has always viewed the true mission of
   Fox News as getting Republicans elected. Fox has never really been
   about journalism. Fox News had Republicans convinced that they had to
   work with the network to survive. Trump has gone against Fox and
   prospered. The aura of power surrounding Fox News has been diminished.

   Donald Trump may unintentionally end up making America great again by
   destroying Fox News.

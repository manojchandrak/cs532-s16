   Attorney for man shot by Baltimore police near Freddie Gray protest
   alleges planted gun; prosecutor scoffs.

   As hundreds rallied at the Western District police station for
   [6]Freddie Gray on April 18, the day before his death, Dawan Hawkins
   was shot five times by a police officer about a mile to the west.

   Hawkins' case never garnered widespread attention.

   This week, the 28-year-old went on trial on a charge of first-degree
   assault, with prosecutors saying he fled a traffic stop and pointed a
   gun at an officer.

   Hawkins' attorney, public defender Martin Cohen, said during closing
   arguments that the gun found on Hawkins had been planted by officers
   because one of them had shot an unarmed man.

   He pointed to an admission by police that the gun had been washed and
   cleaned before it could be tested for DNA or fingerprints. Cohen also
   said Hawkins can be heard in the background of police dispatch tapes
   saying, "I don't got nothing, sir!"

   But Assistant State's Attorney Adam Chaudry told the jury not to be
   deceived.

   "I love a good conspiracy theory, ladies and gentlemen, but what you
   just heard is beyond," Chaudry said.

   Hawkins' trial happened to take place in front of Judge Barry G.
   Williams, who also is overseeing the trials of the Baltimore police
   officers charged in Gray's death. But it was held in his normal
   courtroom, not the larger one used to accommodate media and spectators.
   There were just two people watching this proceeding: Hawkins' uncle and
   sister.

   "It's basically a part of what's going on in Baltimore, and racism
   toward black people," Hawkins' uncle, Jeff Brown-Bey, 58, said of the
   charges his nephew faces.

   Hawkins, who was convicted of having an illegal handgun in 2011, was a
   passenger in a vehicle traveling through West Baltimore that officers
   pulled over because they said the occupants were not wearing seat
   belts.

   Officer David Bodine responded to back up the primary officer. He
   testified that the vehicle had tinted windows, and the occupants could
   only be seen through the windshield, which Cohen said raised questions
   about the officers' justification for the stop.

   The vehicle fled the officers, eventually pulling into the lot of a
   school, and Hawkins jumped out and started to run. Bodine testified
   that he could see Hawkins holding a gun.

   "You could see him fumbling with a dark, metallic handgun," Bodine
   testified. "It popped out of his front waistband. He used both hands to
   shove it down back into his pants."

   Hawkins continued to run and jumped behind a large pipe running along
   the ground, which Bodine referred to as Hawkins taking a "tactical
   position." He said Hawkins raised the gun, pointing it in his
   direction, and Bodine fired.

   "In fear of my life, of being shot, I began discharging," Bodine said.

   At the scene, police located two witnesses and took down their names.
   But Cohen said the investigative file includes no notes of any comments
   the two might have made, and they were not called as witnesses. He said
   Bodine did not say over the police radio that Hawkins had been observed
   with a gun, only that he was pursuing someone who bailed out of a car.

   Chaudry said that the gun was mistakenly cleaned as part of the process
   of test-firing it to see if it was operable. Still, he said, the
   officer's testimony that he had recovered the gun from Hawkins was more
   important than DNA testing.

   "If a child is stealing cookies out of a cookie jar, are you going to
   DNA-test the cookie jar?" Chaudry said. "In a perfect world, maybe DNA
   would've popped up. … At the end of the day, this defendant had this
   weapon on him."

   Cohen said unlike a child getting a timeout or being denied dessert for
   stealing cookies, there were serious stakes for Hawkins. He said police
   should have done a thorough job.

   The jury was deliberating Wednesday afternoon. In addition to
   first-degree assault, Hawkins faces charges of second-degree assault
   and reckless endangerment, as well as gun-related charges.

   President [10]Barack Obama on Wednesday will return to the capital city
   where he launched his bid for the [11]White House nine years ago, a
   visit aimed at reflecting on his political roots while urging the
   country to move beyond the deep partisan divide that has marked his
   time in office and left his home state struggling with a
   record-breaking budget stalemate.

   Obama will deliver his remarks to lawmakers in the ornate House
   chamber, across the rotunda from where he served as a state senator
   from 1997 until elected to the [12]U.S. Senate in 2004. He's expected
   to talk about the reputation he developed there of working across the
   aisle with [13]Republicans as a way to double down on the theme of
   bipartisanship first laid out in his [14]State of the Union speech in
   January.

   He also is expected to again acknowledge his share of responsibility
   for the political gridlock that's worsened since he became president.
   Such rifts are perhaps on no better display than in Illinois, where
   Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and ruling [15]Democrats in the
   legislature have been locked in an ideological battle that has
   threatened to close universities and has led to cuts in programs for
   the elderly, abused and addicted, all while sending the state's debt
   soaring.

   At the same time, Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Obama's former White House chief
   of staff, has called for help from the state to fill a massive budget
   hole at Chicago Public Schools — a cry that largely has gone unheeded
   by Democrats and Republicans alike as the school district has been left
   to slash budgets.

   But Illinois lawmakers should not expect Obama to chart them a path
   forward. He's "not there to offer advice or play back-seat driver,"
   said White House spokesman Josh Earnest, who indicated that the
   president has long thought "it would be fun" to return to where he
   started in politics and talk about the potential for the country to
   find common ground.

   The situation has become so entrenched in Illinois that some political
   observers are looking for any flicker of hope. Obama could make an
   "appeal to the better angels of people's nature," said David Yepsen, a
   longtime political journalist who now is director of the Paul Simon
   Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale.
   "It could be a really poignant moment."

   Rights Amendment (it failed)

   Rights Amendment (it failed)[18]Open link

   "As someone from Chicago and an Illinoisan, he's got to be concerned
   about what's happening in this state, in this city," Yepsen said. "If
   you think about it, you go back in history, there's never been a time
   when there has been a crisis of leadership in both Chicago and
   Springfield like we have today. That has to concern Barack Obama. And
   anything he can do to smooth the waters, to bring people together, I
   think is going to be very helpful to the state."

   The day will not be without political subtext.

   Obama is expected to touch on the need for more transparency in
   elections and his wish to change the way campaigns are financed, a
   message that could be interpreted as a jab at Rauner, a former private
   equity investor who used his personal fortune to pay for his campaign
   for governor. Rauner has continued to tap into his wealth to support
   candidates he thinks could help chip away at the supermajority held by
   Democrats, and he has taken particular aim at loosening the grip of
   longtime House Speaker Michael Madigan.

   For his own part, Rauner has evoked Obama to pursue his own agenda of
   term limits for elected officials and reworking how legislative
   districts are drawn, noting in speeches that they are ideas Obama
   supports, though Democratic leaders in Illinois remain staunchly
   opposed.

   Rauner said he hopes Obama's call for bipartisanship resonates in
   Springfield but was careful to say it was Democrats who need the
   nudging.

   "I don't know who in Washington can say, 'Look and follow our model in
   Washington, we're really working well,'" Rauner said last week. "I know
   he's been frustrated by the gridlock in Washington and he's talked
   about the importance of bipartisan compromise. We need that here. I
   hope he'll talk about that and encourage the supermajority in the
   [19]General Assembly to do some bipartisan comprises with us."

   Rauner invited Obama for a beer at his favorite brewpub a few blocks
   from the Executive Mansion, but the president declined, citing
   scheduling reasons. After the Springfield stop, Obama is set to fly to
   San Jose, where he will attend a fundraiser Thursday.

   Instead, the president and the governor are expected to meet at the
   airport before the speech. Obama also will visit with supporters
   watching his address at a nearby community arts center. The president
   is expected to give remarks there alongside several lawmakers he once
   worked with, including former state Sen. [20]Kirk Dillard, a Republican
   who is now Regional Transportation Authority chairman.

   Dillard said he was invited to appear by the White House along with
   former state Sens. [21]Denny Jacobs, a Democrat from East Moline, and
   Larry Walsh, who's now Will County executive.

   "I tell my children that Dad was a very lucky person that he got to
   work in Springfield with a gentleman who became the president of the
   United States," said Dillard, who during the 2010 governor primary was
   the subject of Republican attack ads for his previous appearance in a
   campaign ad supporting Obama. "I pinch myself every now and again."

   Obama's trip falls on the ninth anniversary of the 2007 kickoff of his
   first White House run, which he launched on the steps of the Old State
   Capitol, the building where President Abraham Lincoln delivered his
   "House Divided" speech. It will be the second time a sitting president
   has addressed lawmakers in the Illinois House — the first was Jimmy
   Carter in May 1978.

   [22]David Axelrod, a top strategist in Obama's presidential campaigns,
   said he expects the speech to focus on Obama's "own experiences in
   Springfield, about his own relationships there and the progress that
   those relationships across the aisle allowed."

   "And he's going to talk about where we are today," said Axelrod, who
   will accompany Obama to Springfield. "I don't know if he'll
   specifically reference the situation in Springfield, but there's a
   larger structural problem in our politics today that he as president
   will address — a polarization."

   Sen. [23]Terry Link, a Democrat from Waukegan, noted that he and Obama
   began in the Senate the same year. At the time, the chamber was
   controlled by Republicans under the leadership of President James
   "Pate" Philip, who "was not what you would consider the most liberal of
   individuals." But Link said Obama found a way to work with Republicans,
   bringing the sides together on polarizing issues, including the passage
   of the state's first racial profiling law. The measure passed with
   bipartisan support, but not until after Democrats regained control of
   the chamber in 2003.

   Link said he believed some of that ability to work across the aisle was
   born in regular poker nights he hosted at his house that Obama and
   other lawmakers would frequent.

   "You hung your guns at the door and you sat down and talked about
   everything but politics," Link said. "It was just six or seven guys
   sitting together for an evening and forming a relationship. We have
   lost that. And I think that's what the president will be trying to
   reiterate to people. 'Hey, we got along, we could find some common
   ground. We are not going to solve everything, but there has to be a
   happy medium.'"

   Republican Sen. [24]Bill Brady of Bloomington also was at those card
   games and recalled a "cordial relationship," even though participants
   had very different agendas. Brady noted, for instance, Obama's call for
   the state to study ways to provide health care to all residents. When
   Republican critics accused him of trying to implement a single-payer
   health care system run by the state, Obama rewrote the bill to call for
   expanding existing programs.

   But Brady expressed little hope that Obama would provide impetus for a
   significant breakthrough to the current stalemate, saying Senate
   Democrats led by President John Cullerton seem willing to compromise
   but have been thwarted by Madigan in the House.

   "We tried to give as much as we could, and it seems the Madigan wing of
   the Democratic Party won't give an inch," Brady said. "I don't know how
   you overcome that."

   Democrats were happy to return the blame.

   "Both the state government and the federal government have a lot in
   common in terms of the problem: It's called the Republican Party. As
   bad as it is here, it's worse in Washington," said Rep. [25]Lou Lang, a
   Skokie Democrat and top Madigan deputy.

   Still, Lang said there is no denying the historical nature of the
   visit.

   "I believe that all of my colleagues, regardless of their political
   persuasion, are looking forward to it," Lang said. "We're proud of him,
   Illinoisans should be proud of him."

   Maaran's Visaaranai

   [78]Akshay Kumar's association with the Tamil film industry is not
   ending any time soon, or so suggest the recent developments. After
   being roped in to play the villain in Shankar's Enthiran 2.0 with
   [79]Rajinikanth, Akshay has now reportedly got the Tamil thriller
   Visaaranai on his mind.

   but an essential one

   Director-producer Priyadarshan is reuniting with Akshay Kumar for the
   Hindi remake of Vetri Maaran's thriller Visaaranai. The
   critically-acclaimed drama, about police brutality, is now being remade
   in Hindi. The remake rights have been bought by director Priyadarshan.

   "Yes, the Hindi remake rights have been acquired by Priyadarshan,"
   Vetri Maaran told IANS.

   Priyadarshan will direct and produce the Hindi remake. Ever since the
   director watched Visaaranai, he hasn't been able to stop praising it.
   Priyadarsan had said, "Visaaranai is one of the finest films I have
   seen in the last ten years."

   According to some reports, Akshay Kumar was rumoured to be part of the
   project. However, Vetri Maaran denied the same.

   "Akshay being a part of the film is just a rumour. It's not true," he
   said.

   Based on the Tamil novel Lock Up by auto driver M Chandrakumar, the
   film is partly inspired from real events from his own life.

   The film, which had its world premiere at the Venice International Film
   Festival last year, is currently running in Indian theatres. It
   features Dinesh, Samuthirakani, Ajay Ghosh and Kishore in important
   roles.

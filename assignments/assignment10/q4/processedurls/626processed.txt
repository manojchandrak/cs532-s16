     OH MY GOD IT WAS SO GOOD I FEEL LIKE I DREAMED IT
     — Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) [61]February 8, 2016

   A landmark Super Bowl 50 is tough to top, but with such a delightfully
   diverse landscape of current music makers, there is surely a solo
   artist or band that can kick off the Super Bowl’s second fifty years.

    [62]Super Bowl Synch Report 2016: Classic Rock, Hip-Hop Score Big In
                             Another Record Year

   Below are 17 thoughts for next year. Vote for your favorite candidate,
   or make your case for an unnamed artist with a write-in vote!
   [63]Who Should Play the Super Bowl Halftime Show Next Year?


   [64]Taylor Swift  -- There are only seven days left until the Grammy
   Awards, and Swifty’s got a nomination for each and every one of them.
   Fresh off her 1989 World Tour (nay, Takeover), Swift’s schedule is
   pretty clear (for now) [65]according to Instagram. (And she’s got her
   pick of the litter with additional musical guests at this point.)

   [66]Walk The Moon -- Perhaps a wildcard selection, this Cincinnati rock
   band got listeners to “Shut Up And Dance” all throughout the summer of
   2015. The Hot 100 top fiver may have only two albums, but their catalog
   is as up-tempo and energetic as their [67]performance execution.

   [68]Adele -- Alright, we know what you’re thinking. “Hello” doesn’t
   immediately spark hands-in-the-air hype. But as the record-breaking
   songstress has shown in both bombastic (and human) performances like
   her [69]triumphant Radio City show and in the close-knit confines of
   [70]James Corden’s “Carpool Karaoke,” this lady is all about the Super
   Bowl’s true values: a cackle and a cold one.

   [71]Kanye West -- Haven’t you heard? Kanye’s dropping [72]the greatest
   album of all time on Thursday. The honeymoon phase should hardly falter
   in about 360 days. We also wouldn’t hate it if he brought out Rihanna
   and [73]Paul McCartney for “FourFiveSeconds.”

   [74]Calvin Harris -- There should be a place for dance music at the
   Super Bowl table, and who better to take the head seat than Harris?
   He’s [75]the first DJ to play Coachella as the premier headliner; he
   might as well be the first one to play a halftime show. Forget
   everything you think you know about live EDM performances being “some
   guy jamming behind a laptop.” Judging by the [76]epic light displays
   dance music has come to be known for, the feast will be for the eyes as
   well as the ears.

   [77]Super Bowl 50 Commercials: 10 Best & 5 Worst

   [78]Shakira  -- A Latin performer has not headlined a halftime show
   since Gloria Estefan in 1992. Considering Shakira’s ample selection of
   hip-swiveling hits (“Waka Waka,” “She Wolf,” “Whenever, Wherever,”
   “Hips Don’t Lie,” etc.), we’re not lying when we say that that’s a
   little ridiculous.

   [79]Janet Jackson -- Janet Jackson’s Unbreakable topped the Billboard
   200 and appeared across many year-end lists in 2015. How badass would
   it be if Jackson staged a Super Bowl comeback and shattered Nipplegate
   once and for all?

   [80]Nicki Minaj -- A female rapper headlining the halftime show? Yes,
   please. Minaj would do well to follow in Missy Elliott’s Super Bowl 49
   footsteps (and has the chops to do so). She [81]rocked Barclays during
   Tidal X this year. “Super Bass” and “Your Love” are old favorites at
   this point, and she’s also got the Bey factor that made [82]Coldplay’s
   stint really sizzle. Perhaps [83]Adele could offer her rapping
   expertise on “Monster”? Sold.

   [84]Justin Bieber -- With hits like “Love Yourself” and “What Do You
   Mean?,” Purpose has converted even the most adamant non-Belieber. And
   come on, how awesome would it be to see dancers clad in “Sorry” music
   video garb storm the stadium?

   [85]Pharrell Williams -- The fact that the “Happy” hit maker has yet to
   headline a Bowl Game makes us kind of sad. The Voice judge exudes
   charisma and already has three solid guest stars from that gig alone:
   [86]Gwen Stefani, [87]Blake Shelton and [88]Adam Levine. Also -- think
   of the dancing minion meme potential! (Left Minion?)

   [89]Super Bowl 50 TV Ratings Steady With Second-Best Overnight Ever

   [90]Maroon 5 -- [91]Rumored to have been in talks about #SB50, Maroon 5
   would be a beyond solid select for 2017. That’s because their catalog
   is built on catchiness. In addition, Levine’s role as a judge on The
   Voice immediately makes him recognizable to viewers of the more
   family-friendly set. (Although, we do love “This Summer’s Gonna Hurt”).

   [92]Luke Bryan -- Bryan always brings a party even non-country girls
   can shake it to. The reigning CMA entertainer of the year has recently
   been expanding his career internationally with his successful [93]Crash
   My Playa festival in Mexico.

   [94]Panic! At The Disco -- While the choice may seem unexpected, so too
   did the punk band’s unseating of both Adele and [95]David Bowie from
   No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with Death of a Bachelor.

   [96]Alabama Shakes -- From millennial alt-rock lovers to their cool
   parents, Alabama Shakes has got everyone moving (and three Grammy noms
   to boot). “Stadium-worthy” would be an understatement to describe
   Brittany Howard’s raw and soulful pipes.

   [97]Lady Gaga -- Gaga’s #SB50 National Anthem sealed that deal for
   anyone who was not already a fan of her work in music, philanthropy and
   acting. The Golden Globe darling and current Oscar nominee has plenty
   of fan favorites to choose from (“The Edge Of Glory,” “Just Dance,”
   “Poker Face,” etc.), and she also has new music in the works for 2016.

   [98]Super Bowl 50 Photos: Lady Gaga, Beyonce, Coldplay & More

   [99]One Direction -- A One Direction reunion would be glorious (and
   even Zayn said it could happen if the [100]“time was right and that was
   the thing to do”). What better time than a halftime show stint ogled by
   millions? Keep 1D fans happy, keep budding solo career builders in the
   forefront? Two birds, one Super Bowl.

   [101]Rihanna -- After months of pent-up Anti-cipation, RiRi should do
   us all a solid and bestow upon us the halftime show of dreams: diamonds
   in the sky, an actual rainstorm worthy of “Umbrella,”and “Pon de
   Replay” (pretty please?).

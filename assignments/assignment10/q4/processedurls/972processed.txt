[VIDEO] TRAINER RICKY FUNEZ BREAKS DOWN CANELO VS. KHAN; THINKS CANELO IS
PICKING ON SMALLER GUY

   By [23]Luis Sandoval | February 10, 2016

   IFRAME: [24]http://www.youtube.com/embed/ylhIPD8nQ7c

   "Why you want to pick on a small guy...don't underestimate Khan...he
   has that questionable chin, but he knows how to survive...he could
   outbox him...you cannot engage with Canelo because Canelo is
   unpredictable...you don't want to get caught by Canelo's punches,"
   stated trainer Ricky Funez, who shared his thoughts on the intriguing
   May 7 clash between Canelo Alvarez and Amir Khan. Check it out!

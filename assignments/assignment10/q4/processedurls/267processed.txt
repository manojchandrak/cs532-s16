   SECURITY guards have been drafted in to police a bus station used by
   rough sleepers.

   Passengers were left to stand and wait in the cold due to growing
   numbers of homeless people congregating in Southend Bus Station, in
   Chichester Road, to drink and smoke.

   With complaints growing, Martin Terry, councillor responsible for
   public protection, waste and transport, demanded something was done or
   the bus station closed down.

   Now security guards from a private company have been brought in to
   guard the shelter from 6am to 10pm Mr Terry said: “I told council
   officers was fed up with the situation. It’s gone on too long now.

   “There is security there now and rough sleepers are moved on from a
   public safety perspective.

   "There are uniformed guards there following complaints from people who
   use the bus station.”

   The tough stance appears to have paid off.

   Karen O’Shea, 46, of Newington Avenue, Southend, who gets the bus to
   and from work in [50]Basildon, was one of the passengers to complain
   about drunk vagrants.

   She said: “It’s definitely got a lot better. You can still see some of
   them sitting about outside but at least we get into the bus shelter
   now.

   “The guards have made a big difference. They are there every morning
   when I go to work and in the evening when I return. I think they should
   be there permanently to be honest. If any members of the public have
   issues they are on hand to help.”

   Teresa Everett, 57, who travels to work in Southend town centre from
   her home in Prittlewell each day has also noticed a big improvement.

   She said: “There are no troublesome drunks in there any more and it
   smells a lot better.

   “They used to lie on the benches and on the floor. You couldn’t sit in
   there because they were laying everywhere.

   “It used to be terrible. They’d be drunk and taking selfies on mobile
   phones in the morning. There would be about 15 of them and people on
   the buses would complain about them.

   “They had taken over the shelter. I’ve even seen nurses bringing them
   their prescriptions. Sometimes they would bring bags with stuff in and
   sometimes they would hand over paper prescriptions. Then you’d see them
   head off to Boots. It's so much better now.”


   How the problem has grown

   THE problem with rough sleepers taking shelter in Southend Bus Station
   has been growing for some time.

   In August last year travellers complained homeless people were using
   the shelter to bed down for the night.

   Councillor Martin Terry said at the time London boroughs were
   encouraging homeless people to come to Southend so they would no longer
   be responsible for them.

   Councillors have recently blamed an increase in rough sleepers on the
   continuing stance of the London boroughs.

   In September, a diabetic man was among 17 people found sleeping rough
   in the shelter even though it was supposed to be locked for the night.

   The council’s tough approach to rough sleepers has recently seen groups
   living in tents on Southend cliffs moved on.

   Council brings in private firm

   SOUTHEND Council said the private security guards will police the town
   centre bus station during opening hours.

   Winns Security, a specialist firm which provides security services for
   council buildings is monitoring the shelter from 6am to 10pm daily.

   Broken locks on the shelter doors have been repaired and secured
   overnight.

   Martin Terry, councillor for responsible public Protection, waste and
   transport, said: “We responded to concerns raised by people using the
   bus station and arranged for a security guard to be present there
   during opening hours.

   “This has helped to reassure passengers, and deter rough sleepers from
   settling down there.

   “We are continuing to monitor the situation and are currently
   considering extending this temporary trial for a few more weeks.”

   i dont see the problem - they are only wanting to stay out of the cold
   - if the homeless shelters are full or are not open they are doing what
   they can to at least have a ''roof'' over thier head. sadly till the
   goverment help thier own first this problem isnt going to go away. yes
   its not ideal their sleeping in the bus garage/shelter but honestly
   isn't it alot better than them sleeping in doorways of shops ??????

   That is not the issue. If they just slept there and cleared all the
   stuff away and moved in the morning there would be no need for
   security. I walk past there several times a day and the issue is they
   are smoking and drinking inside the shelter in large numbers sometimes.
   It is intimidating to the general public. I have even seen them having
   a party complete with music! The mess was terrible. This is a positive
   solution. Every genuine homeless person has access to the services but
   sadly the majority prefer not to engage and cause an problems

   i am a regular bus user and have never felt intimidated by them or
   threatened by them. i simply accept they are homeless, and need to keep
   warm. also the homeless shelters are over run. surely the fact over the
   past couple months that have been a number of deaths within the
   homeless community this shows the need for more services aimed at
   homeless people and more support aimed at them too.. to be fair i dont
   see why you cant smoke in the bus garage - there is not a sign in the
   bus garage anywhere from what i have seen that says no smoking.

   It is very sad they have to congregagte in the shelter and they do need
   help with housing, and drink issues, however this group was very
   intimidating when i went into the shelter with my young child one
   morning to wait for a bus and i can see why people have complained.
   One asked us for money and another was vomiting in a corner and the
   rest were shouting at each other.
   I have never gone in there since.

   I have seen these people in the bus station and I wonder how many of
   them are actually homeless. They seem to have money for drink(and maybe
   drugs)and to keep mobile phones going. They also seem to be quite well
   dressed, leading me to believe that they are just using the bus station
   to loiter, rather than for any need.
   On the occasions I have been there late at night there seems to be an
   altogether different set of rough sleepers who, apart from the odd can
   of drink, seem to want nothing more than a slightly warmer and less wet
   place to sleep.

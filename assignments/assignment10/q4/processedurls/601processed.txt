BMW Drops to Third Place in Luxury Sales Race During January

     * BMW could lose its decade-old lead in deliveries this year

   BMW lost ground in the luxury-car sales race in January, dropping to
   third place as Mercedes-Benz moved closer to a goal of unseating its
   rival this year.

   Global deliveries of BMW AG’s namesake brand rose 7.5 percent in
   January to 133,883 cars, lagging behind Mercedes’s 20 percent leap to
   150,814 cars. While Audi had the slowest growth of the world’s three
   biggest upscale car brands, with sales rising 4 percent, the Volkswagen
   AG unit still outsold BMW with 143,150 vehicles.

   The sales data shows the shifting fortunes of the top luxury-auto
   companies. Daimler AG’s Mercedes, a laggard for a number of years, is
   passing competitors after overhauling its lineup. All-new models and a
   renewed offering of popular and lucrative sport utility vehicles such
   as the GLE are also helping the brand sidestep a general slowdown in
   China, the biggest car market. Meanwhile, BMW’s growth has trailed its
   competitor even as the company added the likes of the revamped 7-Series
   sedan to its lineup.

   “Despite many markets showing continuing volatility, we remain
   optimistic,” Ian Robertson, BMW’s head of sales, said in a
   statement Wednesday.

   Sales of BMW’s flagship 7-Series, in showrooms since October, reached
   3,392 vehicles last month, less than half the 8,473 deliveries for the
   competing S-Class. The Mercedes sedan has been on the market in its
   current iteration for about three years, though the sales figures
   include the newer coupe and ultra-luxury Maybach versions as well.

   The slow ramp-up for BMW’s top-of-the-line vehicle, which featured a
   much-vaunted gesture control function, shows the Bavarian company’s
   struggle to come up with fresh ideas after years of leading the
   competition with rugged SUVs and expanding into new segments. Recent
   lineup additions include two van-like models, the 2-Series Active
   Tourer and Gran Tourer, that sit awkwardly with the brand’s sporty
   image.

Low Profile

   The company, which turns a century old in March, has kept a low profile
   since Harald Krueger, 50, took over as chief executive officer last
   May. Krueger is scheduled to present the results of a strategic review
   next month.

   “During the year of the jubilee, Krueger will want to try and show
   excellent results,” Frank Schwope, a Hanover-based analyst with NordLB,
   said in a report.

   The change in momentum may see BMW lose its sales crown this year,
   according to forecaster IHS Automotive. The carmaker is yielding ground
   to Mercedes in China and introducing comparatively few new models.
   BMW’s January deliveries in China rose 8.4 percent to 43,441 autos,
   compared with a 52 percent gain to 42,671 cars for Mercedes.

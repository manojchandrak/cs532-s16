   David Cameron tried to defend his Government's record on housing and
   homelessness today at [132]Prime Minister's Questions - but his figures
   don't stand up to scrutiny.

   Labour leader [133]Jeremy Corbyn skewered him with a series of tough
   questions on his forthcoming housing bill.

   He asked a question from a member of the public called Rosie, who is
   stuck living with her parents because she can't afford to rent a home
   of her own.

   The PM largely ignored Rosie's plight, instead reeling off a string of
   ropey statistics.

   But look into the figures and many of [134]Mr Cameron's claims quickly
   fall apart.

   Here's four times [135]David Cameron misled MPs over the Conservative
   Party's record on housing.

1. "Homelessness is half the peak that it was under Labour"

   Mr Cameron implied homelessness was on the way down - but is it?

   [136]David Cameron claimed that homelessness is less than half the peak
   it was under the last Labour Government.

   While it's true that homelessness reached its peak at 115,270 in
   2004/05 while Labour were in power, that figure dropped dramatically
   year after year.

   That is, until 2010, when [137]David Cameron became Prime Minister.

   Since then, it's risen every year but one - and has shot up by 55%
   since the Tories swept into number 10.

2. The bar for what counts as being homeless has been raised

   Dan Kitwood
   What counts as being homeless?

   The homelessness statistics in the early 2000s were undeniably quite
   high - but all is not quite as it seems.

   At the time, single men in overcrowded households were counted among
   the homelessness figures.

   The criteria for homelessness has changed since then, with overcrowding
   removed from the stats.

   The bar for what counts as being homeless has been raised - and it's
   still going up under the Tories.

3. "In the last five years we've built more council houses than they've built
in 13 years"

   The PM boasted about his government's record on council house building

   The Prime Minister claimed (correctly) that the number of council
   houses built in the last five years was higher than than in 13 years of
   Labour government.

   What he didn't mention is that the Tories are selling off eight social
   houses for every one new one they build.

   As a result the total stock of council houses in England has gone down
   by 142,589 since [138]David Cameron came to power.

4. And he was talking about council houses, not social housing

   Council houses make up a fraction of all social housing

   Mr Cameron likes to trump up his government's record on building
   council housing - because it's a nice, easy soundbite.

   But the figure is almost meaningless in the full context of social
   housing in the UK - the bulk of social housing is being built by
   Housing Associations.

   The graph below shows the total number of social houses being built,
   broken down into council and Housing Associations.

   Some 328,000 social houses were built under the last Labour government,
   compared to 161,000 between 2010 and May this year.

   So far, the Tories have been building at roughly the same rate (or
   slightly slower) than Labour were in the last years of their
   Government.

   This graph shows the number of completed social houses in Britain every
   year since 1997. Council houses are the red line, housing associations
   are blue and the total is yellow. A steady rise dipped after the Tories
   took power in 2010. Source: DCLG

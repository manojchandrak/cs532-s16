Turkey, Greece seek NATO mission in Aegean - German official

Turkey and Greece have agreed to ask for a NATO mission to monitor refugee
flows in the Aegean Sea and combat people smugglers, a senior German

   BRUSSELS: Turkey and Greece have agreed to ask for a NATO mission to
   monitor refugee flows in the Aegean Sea and combat people smugglers, a
   senior German government official said late on Wednesday.

   "Turkey and Greece are both asking NATO to develop an overview of the
   situation with the national coastguards and Frontex," the German
   official said, referring to Europe's border protection agency.

   Struggling to stop refugees streaming into Greece despite a deal
   between Ankara and the European Union to combat the flood, Germany and
   Turkey surprised partners this week by saying they would raise the
   issue with NATO.

   Turkey has also said it is prepared to take back refugees who are
   rescued at sea or picked up by NATO, the official said. Information
   gathered by NATO should also be passed on to Turkish authorities to go
   after people smugglers, the official added.

   "It is not NATO's remit to push back or stop refugee boats," the
   official said.

   NATO allies already have ships in the eastern Mediterranean, part of
   efforts to shore up Turkey's air defences against missiles from Syria
   and Russian airspace violations.

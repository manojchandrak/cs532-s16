   ​The Atelier Versace spring/summer 2016 finale

   The Versace Medusa – the fashion house's iconic symbol – has been given
   the emoji treatment just in time for Valentine's Day.

   The brand's new free emoji app, which is available for both iOS and
   Android, launches on 14 February and can be used to embellish photos or
   to create original images using a wide range of emoji stickers,
   backgrounds, filters and text-colour options.

   "I love how the new Versace emoji app lets everyone in the world
   express themselves and share their feelings," Donatella Versace said of
   the launch. "To have our own Versace emoji is a real treat for
   Valentine's Day, and I can't wait to begin creating with it."

   To celebrate the new app, the house has also created a capsule
   collection of Versace emoji T-shirts, printed with the Medusa emoji
   either wearing sunglasses or sporting hearts for eyes. The T-shirts
   come in both black and white and will be available online and in
   Versace boutiques worldwide come 14 February.

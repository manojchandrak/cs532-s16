     * Underlying net income of $2,305 million or $3.76 per share in 2015,

   respectively

     Dividends declared in the year of $1.51 per share

   "Our strong fourth quarter capped off a successful year of growth and
   momentum for Sun Life," said Dean Connor, President and Chief Executive
   Officer, Sun Life Financial. "In 2015, we achieved underlying net
   income of $2.3 billion, surpassing our 2015 financial objective of
   $1.85 billion and ended the year with assets under management of $891
   billion. We increased our quarterly common share dividend by 8% while
   maintaining a strong capital position. We also announced six
   transactions, committing $2.4 billion in capital in building our asset
   management businesses, adding capabilities and scale in our U.S.
   operations and strengthening our presence in Asia."

   "The benefits of Sun Life's four pillar strategy, diversified business
   mix, and de-risking actions were evident in 2015. The drop in commodity
   prices, the TSX decline and lower interest rates created headwinds for
   SLF Canada. However, the resulting devaluation of the Canadian dollar
   increased income generated from our business outside of Canada, which
   also benefited from relatively stronger economic growth," said Dean
   Connor.

   "In 2015, our clients received approximately $14 billion in claims and
   benefits payments. Our clients need us now more than ever, and we will
   continue to find new and innovative ways to provide them with the right
   products and solutions to achieve lifetime financial security."

        Financial Measures and Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Financial Measures.

   "Our Canadian operations executed well. We grew our Wealth business
   with the successful launch of our new segregated fund, Sun Life
   Guaranteed Investment Funds, and grew SLGI mutual fund sales by 28%,"
   Connor said. "We ended the year with over 4,100 people in our Career
   Sales Force. Both Group Benefits and Group Retirement Services extended
   their #1 positions in the Canadian market through continuing
   innovation, strong client services and strong sales."

   "In the U.S., we made excellent progress this year in improving the
   profitability of our group life and disability business, and we
   continue to be a leader in medical stop-loss insurance where we
   reported a 12% increase in business in-force year over year," said
   Connor. "Our acquisition of Assurant, Inc.'s U.S. Employee Benefits
   business is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2016,
   and this will add both scale and new capabilities to drive growth in
   our U.S. pillar."

   "MFS maintained its focus on client service and continued its strong
   investment performance," said Connor. "MFS ended the year with assets
   under management of US$413 billion and maintained margins of 40% for
   the year. We expanded our asset management pillar by acquiring Bentall
   Kennedy, Prime Advisors and Ryan Labs in 2015, which together with Sun
   Life Investment Management Inc., generated net sales of $1.5 billion in
   the year."

   "SLF Asia had a strong year, finishing with underlying net income of
   $252 million and increased insurance and wealth sales for 2015," said
   Connor. "We also announced agreements to increase our joint venture
   ownership in PVI Sun Life in Vietnam and Birla Sun Life Insurance in
   India, in line with our Asia strategy."

   Reported net income was $536 million in the fourth quarter of 2015,
   compared to reported net income of $502 million in the fourth quarter
   of 2014. The following table sets out our operating net income and

   The Board of Directors of SLF Inc. today declared a quarterly

   Operational Highlights
   Our strategy is focused on four key pillars of growth. We detail our
   continued progress against these pillars below.

   Fourth Quarter Highlights

   Leader in financial protection and wealth solutions in our Canadian
   home market
   Sales in our Canadian business units continued to grow in the final
   quarter of 2015. In Individual Insurance & Wealth, wealth sales grew by
   13% over the same quarter in 2014 driven by Sun Life Global Investments
   (Canada) Inc. ("SLGI") mutual fund sales. Our new segregated fund
   product, Sun Life Guaranteed Investment Funds, produced sales of $125
   million in the fourth quarter leading to a 57% increase in segregated
   fund sales over the same period in the prior year. Insurance sales grew
   by 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, largely driven by
   participating insurance and term and personal health insurance.

   SLGI reported retail sales of $383 million, up from $204 million in the
   same period of the prior year. In addition, SLGI received the
   Morningstar Award for "Best Pooled Fund of Fund Series" for the Granite
   Target Date Series funds.

   Group Retirement Services ("GRS") had total sales of $2.2 billion,
   compared to $3.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014 which included a
   single large retained case. GRS total sales were driven by strong
   Defined Benefit Solutions ("DBS") sales of $898 million, where we
   continued to innovate in the defined benefit space with a $530 million
   annuity transaction. GRS total sales also included pension rollover
   sales of $687 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, up from $481
   million in the fourth quarter of 2014.

   Our Group Benefits ("GB") business had sales of $78 million in the
   fourth quarter, compared to $209 million in the prior year due to a
   significant large case win in the fourth quarter of 2014. As a result
   of overall growth in net sales, business in-force of $9.1 billion was
   up 6% in the year compared to 2014.

   Premier global asset manager, anchored by MFS
   MFS Investment Management ("MFS") had AUM of US$413 billion as at
   December 31, 2015, compared to US$404 billion as at September 30, 2015.
   Gross sales were US$16.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015 while
   net outflows were US$4.7 billion, primarily due to institutional client
   net outflows.

   MFS's long-term retail fund performance remained strong with 75%, 87%
   and 97% of MFS's mutual fund assets ranked in the top half of their
   Lipper categories based on three-, five- and ten-year performance,
   respectively, as of December 31, 2015.

   Sun Life Investment Management ("SLIM") completed its first full
   quarter following the completion of the acquisitions made in 2015 with
   net sales of $454 million and AUM of $58 billion.

   Leader in U.S. group benefits and International high net worth
   solutions
   On September 9, 2015, we entered into an agreement for the purchase of
   Assurant, Inc.'s U.S. Employee Benefits business ("Assurant EB"). The
   transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of
   2016, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.

   In U.S. Group Benefits, our actions in expense management, claims
   management and pricing continued to improve the results of our U.S.
   life and disability business.

   In December, we re-focused our International business on the life
   insurance segment, where there is greater opportunity to achieve
   stronger growth and profitability and where we will continue to deliver
   a strong value proposition to our customers. At the same time, the
   International wealth business was closed to new sales.

   Growing Asia through distribution excellence in higher growth markets
   In the fourth quarter of 2015, we announced increased investments in
   our joint ventures in Vietnam and India. On January 7, 2016, we
   increased our ownership in our Vietnam joint venture, PVI Sun Life
   Insurance Company Limited ("PVI Sun Life"), from 49% to 75%. In
   December 2015, we announced an agreement to increase our ownership
   interest in Birla Sun Life Insurance Company Limited ("BSLI") from 26%
   to 49%. The BSLI transaction is expected to be completed by the end of
   the first quarter of 2016, subject to regulatory approvals and
   customary closing conditions.

   In SLF Asia, we had individual insurance sales of $147 million in the
   fourth quarter of 2015 which reflected growth in Hong Kong, Indonesia,
   India and Malaysia over the fourth quarter of 2014, offset by lower
   sales in the Philippines which had exceptional sales in the fourth
   quarter of 2014. Overall, wealth sales slowed during the quarter across
   the region, reflecting uncertain market conditions.

   Sun Life of Canada (Philippines), Inc. was awarded the "2015 Life
   Insurance Company of the Year Award" in the Asia Insurance Industry
   Awards. Through this award, we see recognition of our customer focus
   and progress on our Most Respected Agency initiative, an important
   strategy supporting our Asia growth pillar.

   Annual Highlights

   Leader in financial protection and wealth solutions in our Canadian
   home market
     * During 2015, we continued to build our wealth businesses. GRS
       continued to be ranked #1 in market share^(1), with a very strong
       year in defined contribution sales. In addition, Defined Benefit
       Solutions ("DBS") achieved sales of $6.6 billion driven by a $5
       billion ground-breaking large case longevity insurance agreement
       and an innovative annuity transaction of $530 million. Client
       Solutions pension rollover sales were also strong at $2.2 billion,
       increasing by 40% from 2014. In the individual wealth market, we
       launched our new segregated fund product, Sun Life Guaranteed
       Investment Funds, with sales of $259 million for the year. SLGI
       completed its fifth full year of operation, and continued to offer
       top performing funds, with 15 of the 17 mutual funds with five-year
       performance records exceeding the peer median^(2).

   ^(2) ^Morningstar performance statistics as at December 31, 2015.

     * Individual Insurance & Wealth retained its first place position in
       the fixed annuities and critical illness markets at 30.6% and
       30.5%, respectively^(1). Sales of insurance products grew 16%
       year-over-year while wealth sales were up 13%, driven by the Career
       Sales Force, which increased for the eighth consecutive year, and
       strong third-party channel sales activity.
     * GB maintained its leadership position as the top group life and
       health benefits provider in Canada for the sixth consecutive year,
       based on overall revenue^(2).
     * Client Solutions, supporting all of our businesses, announced the
       development of Digital Benefits Assistant, an innovative
       technology-based capability that will proactively engage group plan
       members, deliver personalized and relevant interactions across
       multiple channels, and further support plan members in their goal
       of well-being and financial security.
     * During 2015, we made enhancements to our Group Plan member mobile
       app, including the launch of an Android app, to complement our
       iPhone app, and claims submission capabilities that leverage
       smartphone image capture. These investments have contributed to a
       60% year-over-year increase in our app user traffic.
     * SLF Canada achieved platinum certification from Excellence Canada,
       the highest certification level, recognizing Canada's best run
       corporations across six categories: leadership, strategy, customer
       experience, people engagement, process management and partners.
     * For the seventh year in a row, Canadians have voted Sun Life
       Financial as the "Most Trusted Life Insurance Company", part of the
       Reader's Digest's Trusted Brand‚Ñ¢ awards program.

   Premier global asset manager, anchored by MFS
     * In 2015, we completed the acquisitions of the Bentall Kennedy group
       of companies ("Bentall Kennedy"), Prime Advisors, Inc. ("Prime
       Advisors"), and Ryan Labs Asset Management Inc. ("Ryan Labs").
       These acquisitions build out our strategy to expand our
       capabilities in customized fixed income solutions and alternative
       asset classes in SLIM, now part of our asset management pillar.
     * SLF Asset Management's AUM were $630 billion as at December 31,
       2015 compared to $501 billion as at December 31, 2014, which
       reflects our acquisitions in SLIM and currency impacts from the
       weakening Canadian dollar, partially offset by outflows in MFS and
       market depreciation.
     * MFS's gross sales were US$75.8 billion and net outflows were
       US$15.7 billion in 2015.
     * SLIM's net sales were $1.5 billion and AUM were $58 billion as at
       December 31, 2015.

   Leader in U.S. group benefits and International high net worth
   solutions
     * On September 9, 2015, we entered into an agreement to acquire
       Assurant, Inc.'s U.S. Employee Benefits business. The acquisition
       will increase scale in our life and disability business, add a
       leading dental business with the second largest dental provider
       network in the U.S., and accelerate the development of our worksite
       voluntary business. The acquisition also includes Disability
       Reinsurance Management Services, a business that provides turnkey
       disability management capabilities to third-party carriers. The
       transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of
       2016, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing
       conditions.
     * In U.S. Group Benefits, the expense, claims management and pricing
       actions initiated in 2014 and continued throughout 2015 improved
       the profitability of our U.S. life and disability business. Our
       U.S. medical stop-loss business continued to generate strong,
       profitable growth in 2015, reflecting increased sales and business
       in-force, and strong margins. Stop-loss results benefited from our
       strong leadership position, enhanced underwriting tools and
       expanded distribution.
     * We continued to invest in our U.S. Group Benefits business in 2015,
       adding new capabilities to serve larger customers, complementing
       our strength in the small and middle market segments. We also
       increased our presence on private exchanges, and now participate on
       nine exchanges.
     * In International, we re-focused the business on the life insurance
       segment, where there is greater opportunity to achieve growth and
       profitability and where we will continue to deliver a strong value
       proposition to our customers that aligns strategically to our core
       competencies. At the same time, the International wealth business
       was closed to new sales in December 2015.

   Growing Asia through distribution excellence in higher growth markets
     * We are strengthening our presence in Asia through agreements to
       increase our joint venture ownership in PVI Sun Life in Vietnam,
       which was completed on January 7, 2016, and BSLI in India, which is
       expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2016, to 75%

       company in the Philippines. According to figures released by the
       country's Insurance Commission, our Philippines operation has the
       leadership position among all life insurers in the Philippines
       based on premium income^(1).
     * In SLF Asia, sales from both individual insurance and wealth have
       increased compared to 2014.

   Recognition
     * For the seventh consecutive year, SLF Inc. has been named among the
       2015 Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World (the
       "Global 100"), announced during the World Economic Forum in Davos,
       Switzerland. We are one of nine Canadian companies across all
       sectors, and the top-ranked North American insurance company to
       make the Global 100.
     * Sun Life Financial was one of twelve Canadian companies selected
       for the new Standard & Poor's Long Term Value Creation Global
       Index. The new index, launched in January 2016, is comprised of
       approximately 250 stocks that have the potential to create
       long-term value based on sustainability criteria and financial
       quality.
     * The Globe and Mail's Board Games ranked Sun Life Financial #1 with
       a score of 99 out of a possible 100 points in the 2015 annual
       rating of governance practices of Canadian Boards of Directors
       compiled by the Report on Business.

   How We Report Our Results
   We manage our operations and report our financial results in five
   business segments: Sun Life Financial Canada ("SLF Canada"), Sun Life
   Financial United States ("SLF U.S."), Sun Life Financial Asset
   Management ("SLF Asset Management", previously reported as MFS), Sun
   Life Financial Asia ("SLF Asia"), and Corporate. Information concerning
   these segments is included in our annual consolidated financial
   statements and accompanying notes ("Annual Consolidated Financial
   Statements"), which are prepared using International Financial
   Reporting Standards ("IFRS").

   In the third quarter of 2015, we renamed our MFS segment to SLF Asset
   Management to reflect our acquisitions of Ryan Labs Asset Management
   Inc. ("Ryan Labs"), Prime Advisors, Inc. ("Prime Advisors"), and the
   Bentall Kennedy group of companies ("Bentall Kennedy") in 2015. SLF
   Asset Management includes the operations of MFS, our global asset
   management firm, and the operations of Sun Life Investment Management
   ("SLIM"), our institutional investment management business. The
   acquisitions of Ryan Labs, Prime Advisors and Bentall Kennedy are
   included in SLIM.

   Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures
   We report certain financial information using non-IFRS financial
   measures, as we believe that these measures provide information that is
   useful to investors in understanding our performance and facilitate a
   comparison of our quarterly and full year results from period to
   period. These non-IFRS financial measures do not have any standardized
   meaning and may not be comparable with similar measures used by other
   companies. For certain non-IFRS financial measures, there are no
   directly comparable amounts under IFRS. These non-IFRS financial
   measures should not be viewed as alternatives to measures of financial
   performance determined in accordance with IFRS. Additional information
   concerning these non-IFRS financial measures and reconciliations to the
   closest IFRS measures are included in our annual and interim
   management's discussion and analysis ("MD&A") and the Supplementary
   Financial Information packages that are available on
   [55]www.sunlife.com under Investors - Financial results & reports.
   Reconciliations to IFRS measures are also available in this document
   under the heading Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Financial Measures.

   net income (loss), including operating earnings per share ("EPS") or
   operating loss per share, and operating return on equity ("ROE"), are
   non-IFRS financial measures. Operating net income (loss) excludes from
   reported net income the impact of the following amounts that are not
   operational or ongoing in nature to assist investors in understanding
   our business performance: (i) certain hedges in SLF Canada that do not
   qualify for hedge accounting; (ii) fair value adjustments on MFS's
   share-based payment awards; (iii) acquisition, integration and
   restructuring costs (including impacts related to acquiring and
   integrating acquisitions, previously reported as restructuring and
   other related costs^(1)); (iv) goodwill and intangible asset impairment
   charges; and (v) other items that are not operational or ongoing in
   nature. In 2013, operating net income also excluded impacts related to
   the sale of our U.S. Annuity Business^(2), consisting of the loss on
   sale, related assumption changes and management actions, and related
   restructuring costs. Operating EPS also excludes the dilutive impact of
   convertible instruments.

   Underlying net income (loss) and financial measures based on underlying
   net income (loss), consisting of underlying EPS or underlying loss per
   share, and underlying ROE, are non-IFRS financial measures. Underlying
   net income (loss) removes from operating net income (loss) the impact
   of the following items that create volatility in our results under
   IFRS, and when removed assist in explaining our results from period to
   period: (a) market related impacts; (b) assumption changes and
   management actions; and (c) other items that have not been treated as
   adjustments to operating net income, and when removed assist in
   explaining our results from period to period. Market related impacts
   include: (i) the impact of changes in interest rates that differ from
   our best estimate assumptions in the reporting period on investment
   returns and the value of derivative instruments used in our hedging
   programs, including changes in credit and swap spreads, and any changes
   to the assumed fixed income reinvestment rates in determining the
   actuarial liabilities; (ii) the impact of changes in equity markets,
   net of hedging, above or below our best estimate assumptions of
   approximately 2% growth per quarter in the reporting period and of
   basis risk inherent in our hedging program for products that provide
   benefit guarantees; and (iii) the impact of changes in the fair value
   of real estate properties in the reporting period. Additional
   information regarding these adjustments is available in the footnotes
   to the table included under the heading Q4 2015 vs. Q4 2014 and 2015
   vs. 2014 in the Financial Summary section in this document. Assumption
   changes reflect the impact of revisions to the assumptions used in
   determining our liabilities for insurance contracts and investment
   contracts. The impact on our liabilities for insurance contracts and
   investment contracts of actions taken by management in the current
   reporting period, referred to as management actions include, for
   example, changes in the prices of in-force products, new or revised
   reinsurance on in-force business, or material changes to investment
   policies for asset segments supporting our liabilities. Underlying EPS
   also excludes the dilutive impact of convertible instruments.

   Other non-IFRS financial measures that we use include adjusted
   revenue,  administrative services only ("ASO") premium and deposit
   equivalents, mutual fund assets and sales, managed fund assets and
   sales, premiums and deposits, adjusted premiums and deposits, assets
   under management ("AUM"), assets under administration, and effective
   income tax rate on an operating net income basis.

   Unless indicated otherwise, all factors discussed in this document that
   impact our results are applicable to reported net income (loss),
   operating net income (loss) and underlying net income (loss). Reported
   net income (loss) refers to Common shareholders' net income (loss)
   determined in accordance with IFRS.

   All EPS measures in this document refer to fully diluted EPS, unless
   otherwise stated.

   Q4 2015 vs. Q4 2014
   Our reported net income^ was $536 million in the fourth quarter of
   2015, compared to $502 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating
   net income was $598 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2015,
   compared to $511 million for the same period in the prior year.
   Underlying net income was $646 million in the fourth quarter of 2015,
   compared to $360 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.

   Operating ROE and underlying ROE in the fourth quarter of 2015 were
   12.7% and 13.8%, respectively, compared to 12.6% and 8.8% in the fourth
   quarter of 2014, respectively.

   ^(1)  ^In the fourth quarter of 2015, Acquisition, integration and
         restructuring costs consisted of $63 million related to the closing of
         our wealth business in SLF U.S. International to new sales, which
         included assumption changes and management actions of $41 million to
         reflect assumption updates including the expense strengthening
         associated with closing the business, and $3 million related to our
         acquisitions and integrations of Bentall Kennedy, Prime Advisors and
         Ryan Labs and our pending acquisition of Assurant EB. In the fourth
         quarter of 2014, restructuring costs consisted of transition costs of
         $4 million related to the sale of our U.S. Annuity Business.
   ^(2)  ^Represents a non-IFRS financial measure. See Use of Non-IFRS
         Financial Measures and Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Financial Measures.
   ^(3)  ^Equity market impact consists primarily of the effect of changes
         in equity markets during the period, net of hedging, that differ from
         the best estimate assumptions used in the determination of our
         insurance contract liabilities of approximately 2% growth per quarter
         in equity markets. Equity market impact also includes the income impact
         of the basis risk inherent in our hedging program, which is the
         difference between the return on underlying funds of products that
         provide benefit guarantees and the return on the derivative assets used
         to hedge those benefit guarantees.
   ^(4)  ^Interest rate impact includes the effect of interest rate changes
         on investment returns that differ from best estimate assumptions, and
         on the value of derivative instruments used in our hedging programs.
         Our exposure to interest rates varies by product type, line of business
         and geography. Given the long-term nature of our business, we have a
         higher degree of sensitivity in respect of interest rates at long
         durations. Interest rate impact also includes the income impact of
         changes in assumed fixed income reinvestment rates and of credit and
         swap spread movements.
   ^(5)  ^Experience related items reflect the difference between actual
         experience during the reporting period and best estimate assumptions
         used in the determination of our insurance contract liabilities.

   Our reported net income for the fourth quarter of 2015 and 2014
   included items that we believe are not operational or ongoing in nature
   and which are, therefore, excluded in our calculation of operating net
   income. Operating net income for the fourth quarter of 2015 and 2014
   excluded the net impact of certain hedges that do not qualify for hedge
   accounting in SLF Canada, fair value adjustments on MFS's share-based
   payment awards, and acquisition, integration and restructuring costs.
   The net impact of these items reduced reported net income by $62
   million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to a reduction of $9
   million in the fourth quarter of 2014. In addition, our operating net
   income in the fourth quarter of 2015 increased by $63 million as a
   result of the favourable impact of the weakening Canadian dollar
   relative to the average exchange rates in the fourth quarter of 2014.

   Our underlying net income for the fourth quarter of 2015 and 2014
   excludes market related impacts and assumption changes and management
   actions. The net impact of market related impacts and assumption
   changes and management actions reduced operating net income by $48
   million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to an increase of $151
   million in the fourth quarter of 2014.

   Net income in the fourth quarter of 2015 also reflected favourable
   impact from investment activity on insurance contract liabilities
   largely in SLF Canada and SLF U.S., positive credit and morbidity and
   mortality experience, and other experience items including a change to
   post-retirement benefit liabilities in SLF U.S. This was partially
   offset by unfavourable expense experience including investment in
   growing our businesses.

   Net income in the fourth quarter of 2014 also reflected unfavourable
   impacts of mortality and morbidity, lapse and other policyholder
   behaviour and expense experience, mainly compensation-related and other
   seasonal costs, partially offset by gains from investing activity on
   insurance contract liabilities.

   2015 vs. 2014
   Our reported net income was $2,185 million for 2015, compared to $1,762
   million in 2014. Operating net income was $2,253 million for 2015,
   compared to $1,920 million in 2014. Underlying net income was $2,305
   million, compared to $1,816 million in 2014.

   Operating ROE and underlying ROE for 2015 were 12.6% and 12.8%,
   respectively, compared to 12.2% and 11.6% in 2014, respectively.

   ^(4)  ^ Interest rate impact includes the effect of interest rate
         changes on investment returns that differ from best estimate

   ^(5)  ^Experience related items reflect the difference between actual
         experience during the reporting period and best estimate assumptions
         used in the determination of our insurance contract liabilities.
   ^(6)  ^In 2014, Other items included non-recurring tax benefits
         pertaining to SLF U.K. and MFS.

   Our reported net income for 2015 and 2014 included items that we
   believe are not operational or ongoing in nature and which are,
   therefore, excluded in our calculation of operating net income.
   Operating net income for 2015 and 2014 excluded the net impact of
   certain hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting in SLF Canada,
   fair value adjustments on MFS's share-based payment awards, and
   acquisition, integration and restructuring costs. The net impact of
   these items reduced reported net income by $68 million in 2015,
   compared to a reduction of $158 million in 2014. In addition, our
   operating net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by
   $200 million as a result of the favourable impact of the weakening
   Canadian dollar relative to the average exchange rates in 2014.

   Our underlying net income for 2015 and 2014 adjusts for market related
   impacts and assumption changes and management actions. The net impact
   of market related impacts and assumption changes and management actions
   reduced operating net income by $52 million in 2015, compared to an
   increase of $104 million in the same period in 2014.

   Net income in 2015 also reflected favourable impact from investment
   activity on insurance contract liabilities, positive credit and
   mortality experience, partially offset by unfavourable expense
   experience including investment in growing our businesses and lapse and
   other policyholder behaviour.

   Net income in 2014 also reflected gains from investment activity on
   insurance contract liabilities, favourable credit experience and
   business growth. This was partially offset by unfavourable impacts of
   mortality and morbidity, lapse and other policyholder behaviour and
   expense experience.

   Annual Goodwill and Intangibles Impairment Testing
   The Company completed its annual goodwill and indefinite life
   intangible asset impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2015.
   Impairment charges on intangible assets of $4 million were recognized
   in 2015. No impairment charges were taken as a result of this testing
   in 2014.

   Acquisitions
   Our acquisitions during the fourth quarter of 2015 (and subsequently in
   2016 up to February 10, 2016) are as follows:

   On January 7, 2016, we increased our ownership interest in our joint
   venture insurance company in Vietnam, PVI Sun Life Insurance Company
   Limited, from 49% to 75% by acquiring from PVI Holdings an additional
   26% of the charter capital.

   On December 2, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Aditya Birla
   Nuvo Limited ("ABNL"), a part of the Aditya Birla Group, to increase
   our ownership in Birla Sun Life Insurance Company Limited ("BSLI") from
   26% to 49%, the maximum permitted under foreign ownership rules in
   India, for a consideration of approximately $340 million. This
   transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of
   2016, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.

   Additional information concerning the acquisitions is provided in Note
   3 of our Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and our AIF.

   Impact of Foreign Exchange Rates
   We have operations in many markets worldwide, including Canada, the

   In general, our net income benefits from a weakening Canadian dollar
   and is adversely affected by a strengthening Canadian dollar as net
   income from the Company's international operations is translated back
   to Canadian dollars. However, in a period of losses, the weakening of
   the Canadian dollar has the effect of increasing the losses. The
   relative impact of foreign exchange in any given period is driven by
   the movement of foreign exchange rates as well as the proportion of
   earnings generated in our foreign operations. We generally express the
   impact of foreign exchange on net income on a year-over-year basis.

   During the fourth quarter of 2015, our operating net income increased
   by $63 million as a result of the favourable impact of the weakening
   Canadian dollar in the fourth quarter of 2015 relative to the average
   exchange rates in the fourth quarter of 2014. In addition, during 2015,
   our operating net income increased by $200 million as a result of the
   favourable impact of the weakening Canadian dollar in 2015 relative to
   the average exchange rates in 2014.

   Q4 2015 vs. Q4 2014
   SLF Canada's reported net income was $210 million in the fourth quarter
   of 2015, compared to $117 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.
   Operating net income was $200 million, compared to $123 million in the
   fourth quarter of 2014. Operating net income in SLF Canada excludes the
   impact of certain hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting in
   2015 and 2014, which is set out in the table above.

   Underlying net income in the fourth quarter of 2015 was $269 million,
   compared to $181 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Underlying net
   income excludes from operating net income market related impacts and
   assumption changes and management actions, which are set out in the
   table above. The unfavourable effect of market related impacts in the
   fourth quarter of 2015 was primarily driven by interest rates and
   equity markets, compared to the unfavourable effect in the fourth
   quarter of 2014, primarily driven by interest rates.

   Net income in the fourth quarter of 2015 also reflected gains from
   investing activities on insurance contract liabilities in Individual
   Insurance & Wealth, new business gains in GRS and favourable disability
   experience in GB, partially offset by expense experience including
   investment in growing our individual wealth business.

   Net income in the fourth quarter of 2014 also reflected gains from
   investing activities on insurance contract liabilities in Individual
   Insurance & Wealth and new business gains in GRS, offset by
   unfavourable mortality and morbidity experience in GB and unfavourable
   policyholder behaviour in Individual Insurance & Wealth.

   In the fourth quarter of 2015, Individual Insurance & Wealth sales were
   up 14% in insurance and 13% in wealth compared to the same period last
   year due to strong third-party participating insurance sales, improved
   SLGI mutual fund sales and sales of our new segregated fund, Sun Life
   Guaranteed Investment Funds. Sales of SLGI retail mutual funds
   increased over the fourth quarter of 2014, demonstrating continued
   strong sales growth and positive momentum.

   GB sales declined 63% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 due
   primarily to a significant large case sale last year. GRS new sales of
   $1.3 billion improved $633 million driven by a large $530 million
   combined annuity buy-in transaction. GRS retained sales in the quarter
   of $251 million were lower by $1.6 billion due to a single large
   retained case in the fourth quarter of last year. Pension rollover
   sales of $687 million in the fourth quarter improved 43% over the
   fourth quarter of 2014. Assets under administration for GRS ended the
   quarter at $80.1 billion, an increase of 8% over 2014.

   2015 vs. 2014
   Reported net income was $824 million in 2015, compared to $790 million
   in 2014. Operating net income was $803 million in 2015, compared to
   $797 million in 2014. Operating net income in SLF Canada excludes the
   impact of certain hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting in
   2015 and 2014, which is set out in the table above.

   Underlying net income was $894 million in 2015, compared to $823
   million in 2014. Underlying net income in SLF Canada excludes from
   operating net income market related impacts and assumption changes and
   management actions, which are set out in the table above. The
   unfavourable effect of market related impacts in 2015 was primarily
   driven by equity markets and interest rates, compared to an
   unfavourable effect in 2014 primarily driven by interest rates,
   partially offset by equity markets.

   Net income in 2015 also reflected gains from investing activity on
   insurance contract liabilities in Individual Insurance & Wealth and new
   business gains primarily in GRS. These gains were partially offset by
   expense experience including investment in growing our individual
   wealth business, and, during the first half of 2015, unfavourable
   policyholder behaviour in Individual Insurance & Wealth. In our GB line
   of business, the unfavourable impacts of high cost drug claims, though
   improving in the second half of 2015, were more than offset by positive
   disability experience.

   Net income in 2014 also reflected new business gains in Individual
   Insurance & Wealth and GRS and gains from investing activities on
   insurance contract liabilities in Individual Insurance & Wealth. These
   gains were partially offset by unfavourable morbidity experience in GB
   and unfavourable policyholder behaviour in Individual Insurance &
   Wealth.

   SLF U.S.

   In-force Management. Group Benefits provides protection solutions to

   ^(2) ^In 2015, Acquisition, integration and restructuring costs
        consisted of the impact of US$46 million related to the closing of our
        wealth business in SLF U.S. International to new sales, which included
        assumption changes and management actions of US$30 million to reflect
        assumption updates including the expense strengthening associated with
        closing the business.

   Q4 2015 vs. Q4 2014
   SLF U.S.'s reported net income was C$100 million in the fourth quarter
   of 2015, compared to C$168 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.
   Operating net income was C$163 million, compared to C$168 million in
   the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating net income in SLF U.S. excludes
   the impact of acquisition, integration and restructuring costs which
   included assumption changes and management actions related to the
   closing of our International wealth business to new sales in 2015,
   which are set out in the table above. Underlying net income was C$158
   million, compared to C$13 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The
   favourable impact of the weakening Canadian dollar relative to average
   exchange rates in the fourth quarter of 2014 increased operating net
   income by $24 million.

   SLF U.S.'s reported net income was US$75 million in the fourth quarter
   of 2015, compared to US$146 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.
   Operating net income was US$121 million in the fourth quarter of 2015,
   compared to US$146 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Underlying
   net income was US$118 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared
   to US$9 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Underlying net income
   excludes from operating net income market related impacts and
   assumption changes and management actions, which are set out in the
   table above. The favourable effects of market related impacts in the
   fourth quarter of 2015 were primarily driven by interest rate and
   equity market changes, compared to a favourable effect in the fourth
   quarter of 2014, primarily driven by the impact of credit spreads
   partially offset by interest rate changes.

   Net income in the fourth quarter of 2015 also reflected the impact in
   Group Benefits related to pricing increases on new and renewing
   business, expense actions, and continued investment in our disability
   claim operations. Results also reflected the favourable impact of
   investing activities on insurance contract liabilities, favourable
   credit experience, net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale
   ("AFS") assets, favourable mortality experience in International, and a
   change to post-retirement benefit liabilities. These items were
   partially offset by unfavourable group life claims experience.

   Net income in the fourth quarter of 2014 also reflected unfavourable
   underwriting experience in Group Benefits, unfavourable mortality
   experience in In-force Management and International, and unfavourable
   expense experience.

   Sales in Group Benefits in the fourth quarter of 2015 decreased 9%
   compared to the prior year quarter. International life sales in the
   fourth quarter increased $13 million compared to the fourth quarter of
   2014.

   2015 vs. 2014
   SLF U.S.'s reported net income was C$333 million in 2015, compared to
   C$341 million in 2014. Operating net income was C$396 million in 2015,
   compared to C$341 million in 2014. Operating net income in SLF U.S.
   excludes the impact of acquisition, integration and restructuring costs
   which included assumption changes and management actions related to the
   closing of our International wealth business to new sales in 2015.
   Underlying net income was C$441 million in 2015, compared to C$266
   million in 2014. The favourable impact of the weakening Canadian dollar
   in 2015 relative to average exchange rates in 2014 increased operating
   net income by $54 million.

   In U.S. dollars, SLF U.S.'s reported net income was US$251 million in
   2015, compared to US$305 million in 2014. Operating net income was
   US$297 million in 2015, compared to US$305 million in 2014. Underlying
   net income was US$341 million in 2015, compared to US$240 million in
   2014. Underlying net income excludes from operating net income market
   related impacts and assumption changes and management actions, which
   are set out in the table above. The favourable effect of market related
   impacts in 2015 was primarily driven by credit spreads partially offset
   by equity market changes, compared to an unfavourable impact in 2014
   primarily driven by interest rates.

   Net income in 2015 also reflected the impact in Group Benefits related
   to pricing increases on new and renewing business, expense actions, and
   continued investment in our disability claim operations. Results also
   reflected positive credit experience, net realized gains on the sale of
   AFS assets, favourable tax items related to prior years,  the
   favourable impact of investing activities on insurance contract
   liabilities, favourable mortality experience in International, and a
   change to post-retirement benefit liabilities. These items were
   partially offset by unfavourable underwriting experience in Group
   Benefits and unfavourable mortality and policyholder behaviour
   experience in In-force Management.

   Net income in 2014 also reflected the impact of unfavourable mortality
   experience in group life and In-force Management, unfavourable
   underwriting experience in our group disability business and
   unfavourable expense experience, partially offset by the impact of net
   realized gains on the sale of AFS assets, favourable credit experience
   and positive investment activity.

   set out in the table above. The favourable impact of the weakening
   Canadian dollar in the fourth quarter of 2015 relative to average
   exchange rates in the fourth quarter of 2014 increased operating net
   income by $27 million.

   SLF Asset Management's net income increased in the fourth quarter of
   2015 compared to the same period in 2014 primarily due to the
   favourable impact of exchange rates.

   In U.S. dollars, MFS's reported net income was US$126 million in the
   fourth quarter of 2015, compared to US$137 million in the fourth
   quarter of 2014. MFS's operating net income was US$131 million in the
   fourth quarter of 2015, compared to US$137 million in the fourth
   quarter of 2014. Operating net income in MFS excludes the impact of
   fair value adjustments on share-based payment awards, which is set out
   in the table above. MFS's operating net income in U.S. dollars
   decreased in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in
   2014, primarily due to lower average net assets. MFS's pre-tax
   operating profit margin ratio was 38% in the fourth quarter of 2015,
   down from 39% in the fourth quarter of 2014.

   SLIM's reported net income and operating net income was C$9 million in
   the fourth quarter of 2015. SLIM's net income in the fourth quarter of
   2015 primarily reflected the 2015 acquisitions in SLIM.

   SLF Asset Management's AUM was C$629.6 billion as at December 31, 2015,
   compared to C$500.7 billion as at December 31, 2014. The increase in
   SLF Asset Management's AUM was primarily due to the acquisitions in
   SLIM in the third quarter of 2015. MFS's AUM was US$413.2 billion
   (C$571.9 billion) as at December 31, 2015, compared to US$431.0 billion
   (C$500.7 billion) as at December 31, 2014. The decrease of US$17.8
   billion was primarily driven by gross sales of US$75.8 billion, more
   than offset by redemptions of US$91.5 billion and asset depreciation of
   US$2.1 billion. Market volatility during the second half of 2015
   contributed to a decrease in gross sales across MFS's retail and
   institutional product lines. In addition, some large institutional
   clients rebalanced their investments leading to redemptions that were
   larger than usual. These factors were the major drivers to MFS's net
   outflows in the third and fourth quarters. MFS's investment performance
   remains strong with 75%, 87% and 97% of MFS's retail fund assets ranked
   in the top half of their Lipper categories based on three-, five- and
   ten-year performance, respectively at December 31, 2015. SLIM's AUM was
   C$57.8 billion as at December 31, 2015.

   2015 vs. 2014
   SLF Asset Management's reported net income was C$691 million in 2015,
   compared to C$491 million to 2014. SLF Asset Management had operating
   net income and underlying net income of C$700 million in 2015, compared
   to C$616 million in 2014. Operating net income and underlying net
   income in SLF Asset Management excludes the impact of fair value
   adjustments on MFS's share-based payment awards, which is set out in
   the table above. The favourable impact of the weakening Canadian dollar
   in 2015 relative to average exchange rates in 2014 increased operating
   net income by $95 million.

   MFS's reported net income for 2015 was US$531 million, compared to
   US$443 million for 2014. MFS's operating net income was US$540 million
   in 2015, compared to US$557 million in 2014. MFS's operating net income
   in U.S. dollars for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased compared
   to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to compensation
   costs and continued investment in technological infrastructure
   partially offset by higher average net assets.

   SLIM's reported net income and operating net income for the year ended
   December 31, 2015 was C$12 million. SLIM's net income in 2015 primarily
   reflected the results of the 2015 acquisitions in SLIM.

   Q4 2015 vs. Q4 2014
   SLF Asia's reported net income and operating net income was $73 million
   in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to reported net income and
   operating net income of $62 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.
   There were no operating net income adjustments in SLF Asia in 2015 or
   2014. The favourable impact of the weakening Canadian dollar in the
   fourth quarter of 2015 relative to average exchange rates in the fourth
   quarter of 2014 increased operating net income by $9 million.

   Underlying net income was $52 million, compared to $50 million in the
   fourth quarter of 2014. Underlying net income excludes from operating
   net income market related impacts and assumption changes and management
   actions, which are set out in the table above. The favourable effect of
   market related impacts in the fourth quarter of 2015 were primarily
   driven by interest rate and equity market changes, compared to the
   unfavourable effect in the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily driven by
   interest rate and equity market changes.

   Net income in the fourth quarter of 2015 reflected business growth
   partially offset by lower gains from the sale of AFS assets compared to
   the fourth quarter of 2014.

   Total individual life sales in the fourth quarter of 2015 were up 11%
   from the fourth quarter of 2014, or down 1% excluding currency impact.
   This reflects growth in Malaysia, Hong Kong, Indonesia and India, up
   40%, 16%, 6% and 4%, respectively, in local currency, offset by lower
   sales in the Philippines, which had exceptional sales in the fourth
   quarter of 2014, Vietnam and China. Sales increases were driven by
   growth in our agency channel in Hong Kong, Indonesia and India, and in
   bancassurance sales in Malaysia and Indonesia. SLF Asia wealth sales
   were $1.7 billion, compared to $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter of
   2014, driven by decreased sales in China, India and Hong Kong mainly
   due to market volatility.

   2015 vs. 2014
   Reported net income and operating net income was $311 million in 2015,
   compared to reported net income and operating net income of $182
   million in 2014. There were no operating net income adjustments in SLF
   Asia in 2015 or 2014. The favourable impact of the weakening Canadian
   dollar in 2015 relative to average exchange rates in 2014 increased
   operating net income by $35 million.

   Underlying net income was $252 million, compared to $174 million in
   2014. Underlying net income excludes from operating net income market
   related impacts and assumption changes and management actions, which
   are set out in the table above. The favourable effect of market related
   impacts in 2015 was primarily driven by interest rate and equity market
   changes, compared to an unfavourable effect in 2014 primarily driven by
   interest rates partially offset by equity market changes.

   Net income in 2015 increased compared to 2014, primarily driven by
   business growth.

   Individual life insurance sales in 2015 were up 16% from 2014, or
   increased by 4% excluding currency impact. Sales increased across the
   region, except in China and India, with agency sales growth in the
   Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam of 16%, 23% and 85%, respectively,
   measured in local currency. Sales in Malaysia were up 29%, driven by
   growth in the bancassurance and telemarketing channels. Sales in Hong
   Kong were level with 2014. Wealth sales increased from 2014, driven by
   increases in India and China.

   Q4 2015 vs. Q4 2014
   Corporate had reported net loss of $24 million in the fourth quarter of
   2015, compared to reported loss of $2 million in the fourth quarter of
   2014. Operating net loss was $21 million in the fourth quarter of 2015,
   compared to an operating net income of $2 million in the same period in
   the prior year. Operating net income (loss) excludes acquisition,
   integration and restructuring costs in 2015 and 2014, which are set out
   in the table above. The favourable impact of the weakening Canadian
   dollar in the fourth quarter of 2015 relative to average exchange rates
   in the fourth quarter of 2014 decreased operating net loss by $3
   million.

   Underlying net loss was $16 million, compared to underlying net loss of
   $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Underlying net income (loss)
   excludes from operating net income (loss) market related impacts and
   assumption changes and management actions, which are set out in the
   table above. The unfavourable effect of market related impacts in the
   fourth quarter of 2015 were primarily driven by equity markets
   partially offset by interest rates, compared to the favourable effect
   in the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily driven by interest rates.

   SLF U.K.'s operating net income was $22 million in the fourth quarter
   of 2015, compared to $65 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. SLF
   U.K.'s net income in the fourth quarter of 2015 reflected unfavourable
   equity markets and the impact of a tax rate change partially offset by
   the impact of interest rates. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2014
   reflected the favourable impact of assumption changes and management
   actions and market related impacts.

   Corporate Support had an operating net loss of $43 million in the
   fourth quarter of 2015, compared to an operating net loss of $63
   million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Net loss in the fourth quarter
   of 2015 declined relative to the same period in 2014, primarily due to
   lower operating expenses.

   2015 vs. 2014
   The reported net income was $26 million in the Corporate segment in
   2015, compared to a reported net loss of $42 million in 2014. Operating
   net income was $43 million in 2015, compared to an operating net loss
   of $16 million in 2014. Operating net income (loss) excludes
   acquisition, integration and restructuring costs in 2015 and 2014,
   which are set out in the table above. The favourable impact of the
   weakening Canadian dollar in 2015 relative to average exchange rates in
   2014 increased operating net income by $16 million.

   Underlying net income was $18 million in 2015, compared to an
   underlying net loss of $63 million in 2014. Underlying net income
   (loss) excludes from operating net income (loss) market related impacts
   and assumption changes and management actions, which are set out in the

   was primarily driven by interest rates partially offset by equity
   markets, compared to a favourable effect in 2014, primarily driven by
   interest rates and partially offset by equity markets.

   SLF U.K.'s operating net income was $200 million in 2015, compared to
   $174 million in 2014. Net income in 2015 reflected favourable effect of

   items.

   In Corporate Support, the operating net loss was $157 million in 2015,
   compared to an operating net loss of $190 million in 2014. The decrease
   in loss in 2015 relative to 2014 was due to lower preferred share

        Financial Measures.

   Revenue was $5.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to
   $7.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease was primarily
   driven by decreases in the fair value of fair value through profit and
   loss ("FVTPL") assets, partially offset by higher net premium revenue
   in SLF Canada and SLF Asia, favourable currency impact from the
   weakening Canadian dollar, and higher fee income in SLF Asset
   Management and SLF Canada. The currency impact from the weakening of
   the Canadian dollar relative to average exchange rates in the fourth
   quarter of 2014 increased revenue by $393 million. Adjusted revenue was
   $7.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $6.3 billion in
   the fourth quarter of 2014 primarily due to increased net premium
   revenue in SLF Canada and SLF Asia, and higher fee income in SLF Asset
   Management and SLF Canada.

   Revenue of $19.3 billion in 2015 was down $6.5 billion from revenue of
   $25.8 billion in 2014. The decrease was primarily driven by decreases
   in the fair value of FVTPL assets and lower net premium revenue in SLF
   U.S., partially offset by favourable currency impact from the weakening
   Canadian dollar, higher net premium revenue in SLF Canada and SLF Asia,
   and increased fee income in SLF Asset Management and SLF Canada. The
   weakening of the Canadian dollar relative to average exchange rates in
   2014 increased revenue by $1.4 billion. Adjusted revenue in 2015 was
   $24.3 billion, an increase of $0.1 billion from 2014. The increase in
   adjusted revenue was primarily attributable to increased net premium
   revenue in SLF Canada and SLF Asia, and higher fee income in SLF Asset
   Management and SLF Canada, partially offset by lower net premium
   revenue in SLF U.S primarily due to lower International sales.

   Premiums and deposits^ were $33.8 billion for the quarter ended
   December 31, 2015, compared to $31.8 billion for the quarter ended
   December 31, 2014. The weakening of the Canadian dollar relative to
   average exchange rates in the fourth quarter of 2014 increased total
   premiums and deposits by approximately $4.0 billion. Total adjusted
   premiums and deposits in the fourth quarter of 2015 were down $2.0
   billion compared to the same period last year. The decrease was mainly
   due to SLF Asset Management, with lower fund sales in MFS partially
   offset by fund sales in SLIM including the 2015 acquisitions, and
   increased net premium revenue and segregated fund deposits in SLF
   Canada.

   Premiums and deposits were $137.2 billion in 2015, compared to $122.5
   billion in 2014, primarily attributable to $15.1 billion favourable
   currency impact from the weakening Canadian dollar. Adjusted premiums
   and deposits of $126.8 billion in 2015 decreased $0.2 billion compared
   to 2014. The decrease was largely driven by lower fund sales in MFS and
   decreased net premium revenue in SLF U.S., partially offset by fund
   sales in SLIM, increased net premium revenue and fund sales in SLF
   Canada and SLF Asia, and higher segregated fund deposits in GRS in SLF
   Canada.

   Net premium revenue, which reflect gross premiums less amounts ceded to
   reinsurers, were $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared
   to $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. Net life, health and
   annuity premium revenues were $10.4 billion for 2015, up $0.4 billion
   from 2014. In both cases, the increase was primarily attributable to
   favourable currency impact from the weakening Canadian dollar, and
   increases in SLF Canada and SLF Asia, partially offset by decreases in
   SLF U.S.

   Segregated fund deposits were $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter of
   2015, compared to $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014.
   Segregated fund deposits were $12.0 billion in 2015, compared to $9.2
   billion in 2014. In both cases, the change mainly reflected an increase
   in GRS in SLF Canada, and favourable currency impact from the weakening
   Canadian dollar, partially offset by lower deposits in SLF Asia.

   Sales of mutual funds and managed funds were $25.9 billion in the
   fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $0.8 billion over the fourth
   quarter of 2014, reflecting favourable currency impact from the
   weakening Canadian dollar, fund sales in SLIM and SLF Canada, partially
   offset by lower fund sales in MFS and SLF Asia. Mutual and managed fund
   sales were $107.6 billion in 2015, compared to $96.5 billion in 2014,
   primarily driven by favourable currency impact from the weakening
   Canadian dollar and fund sales in SLIM, SLF Canada and SLF Asia,
   partially offset by lower fund sales in MFS.

   ASO premium and deposit equivalents of $1.8 billion in the fourth
   quarter of 2015 were down $0.1 billion from the fourth quarter of 2014,
   mainly reflecting decreases from GRS in SLF Canada, partially offset by
   increases in GB in SLF Canada, Hong Kong in SLF Asia and the favourable
   currency impact from the weakening Canadian dollar. ASO premium and
   deposit equivalents for 2015 increased $0.4 billion from 2014,
   primarily attributable to increases from GB in SLF Canada, Hong Kong in
   SLF Asia and the favourable currency impact from the weakening Canadian
   dollar, partially offset by decreases from GRS in SLF Canada.

   Total Company life and health sales were $767 million in the fourth
   quarter of 2015, compared to $816 million in the same period last year.
     * SLF Canada life and health sales were $178 million in the fourth
       quarter of 2015, compared to $297 million in the fourth quarter of
       2014, primarily reflecting lower sales in GB, partially offset by
       higher sales in the Individual insurance business
     * SLF U.S. life and health sales were $427 million in the fourth
       quarter of 2015, compared to $381 million in the fourth quarter of
       2014, largely due to favourable currency impact of $63 million from
       the weakening Canadian dollar and higher sales in individual
       insurance in International, partially offset by lower sales in
       Group Benefits
     * SLF Asia life and health sales were $162 million in the fourth
       quarter of 2015, compared to $138 million in the fourth quarter of
       2014, mainly attributable to favourable currency impact of $18
       million from the weakening Canadian dollar and sales growth in Hong
       Kong, Indonesia, China and Malaysia

   Total Company wealth sales were $29.6 billion in the fourth quarter of
   2015, compared to $29.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014.
     * SLF Canada wealth sales were $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter of
       2015, compared to $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014,
       mainly reflecting lower retained sales in GRS, partially offset by
       higher sales in the Individual wealth business
     * SLF U.S. wealth sales were $96 million in the fourth quarter of
       2015, compared to $161 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, due
       to lower wealth product sales in International, partially offset by
       favourable currency impact of $14 million from the weakening
       Canadian dollar
     * SLF Asia wealth sales were $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter of
       2015, compared to $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014,
       driven by decreased fund sales in China, India and Hong Kong,
       partially offset by the favourable currency impact of $0.2 billion
       from the weakening Canadian dollar
     * SLF Asset Management gross sales were $24.2 billion in the fourth
       quarter of 2015, compared to $23.3 billion in the fourth quarter of
       2014, largely reflecting favourable currency impact and the
       addition of Ryan Labs, Prime Advisors and Bentall Kennedy,
       partially offset by lower fund sales from MFS

   Assets Under Management
   AUM consist of general funds, segregated funds and other AUM. Other AUM
   includes mutual funds and managed funds, which include institutional
   and other third-party assets managed by the Company.

   AUM^ were $891.3 billion as at December 31, 2015, compared to AUM of
   $734.4 billion as at December 31, 2014. The increase in AUM of $156.9
   billion between December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 resulted
   primarily from:

   (i)        an increase of $111.3 billion from the favourable currency
              impact of the weakening of the Canadian dollar against foreign
              currencies compared to the prior period exchange rates;
   (ii)       $52.3 billion increase from the acquisition of Ryan Labs,
              Prime Advisors and Bentall Kennedy; and
   (iii)      business growth and other of $8.4 billion; partially offset
              by
   (iv)       net outflows of mutual, managed and segregated funds of $12.2
              billion;
   (v)        a decrease of $2.0 billion from the change in value of FVTPL
              assets and liabilities; and
   (vi)       unfavourable market movements on the value of mutual funds,
              managed funds and segregated funds of $0.9 billion.

   Changes in the Statements of Financial Position and in Shareholders'
   Equity
   Total general fund assets were $155.4 billion as at December 31, 2015,
   compared to $139.4 billion as at December 31, 2014. The increase in
   general fund assets from December 31, 2014 was primarily a result of
   currency impact of the weakening Canadian dollar of $10.8 billion and
   business growth of $7.2 billion, partially offset by a $2.0 billion
   decrease from the change in value of FVTPL assets and liabilities.

   Insurance contract liabilities (excluding other policy liabilities and
   assets) of $103.7 billion as at December 31, 2015 increased by $8.5
   billion compared to December 31, 2014, mainly due to currency impact
   from the weakening Canadian dollar and balances arising from new
   policies, partially offset by changes in balances on in-force policies
   (which includes fair value changes on FVTPL assets supporting insurance
   contract liabilities).

   Shareholders' equity, including preferred share capital, was $21.3
   billion as at December 31, 2015, compared to $18.7 billion as at
   December 31, 2014. The $2.6 billion increase in shareholders' equity
   was primarily due to:

   (i)      shareholders' net income of $2,285 million in 2015, before
   preferred share dividends of $100 million;
   (ii)      an increase of $1,645 million from the weakening of the
   Canadian dollar relative to foreign currencies; and
   (iii)      proceeds of $88 million from the issuance of common shares
   through the Canadian dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan, $34
   million issued as consideration for business acquisition, $44 million
   from stock options exercised and $3 million from stock-based
   compensation; partially offset by
   (iv)      common share dividend payments of $918 million;
   (v)      common share repurchases of $212 million;
   (vi)      net change in AFS assets in other comprehensive income
   ("OCI") of $298 million; and
   (vii)      changes in liabilities for defined benefit plans in OCI of
   $49 million.

   Income Taxes
   In the fourth quarter of 2015, on a reported basis we had an Income tax
   expense of $180 million on Income before taxes of $741 million, which
   resulted in an effective income tax rate of 24.3%. This compares to an
   Income tax expense of $124 million on Income before taxes of $658
   million and an effective income tax rate of 18.8% in the fourth quarter
   of 2014.

   On an operating basis^(1), in the fourth quarter of 2015, we had an
   income tax expense of $190 million on our operating income of $826
   million, representing an effective income tax rate of 23.0%. This
   compares to an income tax expense of $113 million on operating income
   before taxes of $665 million and an effective income tax rate of 17.0%
   in the fourth quarter of 2014. The effective tax rate calculated on an
   operating basis excludes amounts attributable to participating
   policyholders and non-operating items.

   The provincial corporate tax rate increased in Alberta, Canada
   effective the second quarter of 2015, and as a result, our statutory
   tax rate increased from 26.5% to 26.75% for 2015 and future years. Our
   statutory tax rate is normally reduced by various tax benefits, such as
   lower taxes on income subject to tax in foreign jurisdictions, a range
   of tax exempt investment income and other sustainable tax benefits that
   are expected to decrease our effective tax rate to a range of 18% to
   22%.

   Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2015 was above the
   expected range mainly due to the impact of a tax rate change in the
   U.K., partially offset by adjustments with respect to prior years and
   resolution of tax audits.

   Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2014 was further
   reduced due to favourable adjustments to taxes of prior years, which
   were offset by an accrual of interest expense related to taxes recorded
   in pre-tax income.

   __________
   ^(1) Our effective income tax rate on an operating net income basis is
   calculated using operating net income and income tax expense
   associated  with operating net income.

   Investments
   We had total general fund invested assets of $138.0 billion as at
   December 31, 2015, compared to $125.2 billion as at December 31, 2014.
   The increase in general fund invested assets of $12.8 billion was
   primarily due to the currency impact of the weakening Canadian dollar
   and operating activity partially offset by a decrease from changes in
   fair value. Our general fund is primarily invested in fixed income
   instruments, including debt securities and mortgages and loans, with
   85.5% of the general fund invested assets invested in cash and fixed
   income investments. Equity securities and investment properties
   represented 3.8% and 4.7% of the portfolio, respectively and the
   remaining 6.0% of the portfolio consisted of policy loans, derivative
   assets and other invested assets. Our general fund invested assets are
   well diversified across investment types, geographies and sectors.

   The following table sets out the composition of our general fund
   invested assets^(1).

   ^(1) ^The invested asset values and ratios presented are based on the
        carrying value of the respective asset categories. The carrying values
        ^for FVTPL and AFS invested assets are generally equal to their fair
        values. For invested assets supporting insurance contracts, in the
        event of
        ^default, if the amounts recovered are insufficient to satisfy the
        related insurance contract liability cash flows that the assets are
        intended to
        ^support, credit exposure may be greater than the carrying value of the
        assets.

   Sector Exposure
   Our general fund invested assets are well diversified across investment
   types, geographies and sectors.

   As at December 31, 2015, our exposure to the energy sector for debt
   securities and corporate loans was $5.6 billion, of which 93% was rated
   investment grade ($5.5 billion, of which 98% was rated investment grade
   as at December 31, 2014). Approximately 45% of our energy sector
   exposure was invested in pipeline, storage and transportation entities,
   approximately 15% was invested in integrated oil and gas entities, and
   the remaining exposure was invested in companies involved in
   exploration and production, refining and drilling and servicing, which
   included approximately 7% in drilling and oil field services.

   Our mortgage and real estate portfolio includes office, industrial,
   retail, and multi-family buildings occupied by tenants in diversified
   industries. Our most significant property exposure to the oil and gas
   sector was located in Alberta, which represented approximately 8% of
   our mortgage portfolio and approximately 21% of our real estate
   portfolio. Within our Alberta portfolio, there has been no significant
   change in exposure to energy sector tenants and there have been no
   material indications of stress such as arrears, mortgage defaults and
   tenant insolvencies. However, as the period of weak energy prices
   continues, market fundamentals within the province are deteriorating,
   resulting in rising vacancy levels and lower rental rates, which should
   they continue, may lead to further reductions in valuations
   particularly in the office sector. We continue to closely monitor the
   impact of these market changes in the energy sector on the real estate
   and mortgage portfolios.

   As at December 31, 2015, our exposure to the metals and mining
   sub-sector consists of debt securities and was $0.8 billion, of which
   97% is investment grade and is diversified by several different
   commodity types. The metals and mining sub-sector is included in the
   Materials line of the Debt Securities by Issuer and Industry Sector
   table included in the Debt Securities section of our 2015 annual MD&A.

   Debt Securities
   Our debt securities portfolio is actively managed through a regular
   program of purchases and sales aimed at optimizing yield, quality and
   liquidity, while ensuring that it remains well diversified and
   duration-matched to insurance contract liabilities. As at December 31,
   2015, we held $69.9 billion of debt securities, representing 50.7% of
   our total invested assets, compared to $66.2 billion representing 52.9%
   as at December 31, 2014. Debt securities with a credit rating of "A" or
   higher represented 67.9% of the total debt securities as at
   December 31, 2015, consistent with December 31, 2014. Debt securities
   with a credit rating of "BBB" or higher represented 96.9% of total debt
   securities as at December 31, 2015, compared to 97.3% as at
   December 31, 2014.

   Corporate debt securities not issued or guaranteed by sovereign,
   regional and municipal governments represented 66.0% of our total debt
   securities as at December 31, 2015, compared to 66.7% as at
   December 31, 2014. Total government issued or guaranteed debt
   securities as at December 31, 2015 were $23.8 billion, compared to
   $22.1 billion as at December 31, 2014. With the exception of certain
   countries where we have business operations, including Canada, the
   United States, the United Kingdom and the Philippines, our exposure to
   debt securities from any single country did not exceed 1% of total
   invested assets on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as
   at December 31, 2015.

   The carrying value of debt securities of governments and financial
   institutions by geographic location is presented in the following

        ^exposure to Greece. Of our exposure to Eurozone countries, 99.1% was
        rated investment grade and 77.4% had a credit rating of "A" or higher.

   Our gross unrealized losses as at December 31, 2015 for FVTPL and AFS
   debt securities were $1.1 billion and $0.22 billion, respectively,
   compared with $0.22 billion and $0.04 billion, respectively, as at
   December 31, 2014. The increase in gross unrealized losses was largely
   due to the impact of rising interest rates, including credit spreads,
   primarily in the U.S.

   Our debt securities as at December 31, 2015 included $12.3 billion
   invested in the financial sector, representing approximately 17.5% of
   our total debt securities, or 8.9% of our total invested assets. This
   compares to $12.5 billion, or 18.9% of the total debt security
   portfolio, or 10.0% of our total invested assets as at December 31,
   2014.

   Our debt securities as at December 31, 2015 included $4.9 billion of
   asset-backed securities reported at fair value, representing 7.1% of
   our total debt securities, or 3.6% of our total invested assets. This
   compares to $4.4 billion representing 6.7% of total debt securities or
   3.6% of our total invested assets as at December 31, 2014.

   Mortgages and Loans
   Mortgages and loans disclosures in this section are presented at their
   carrying value on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. As
   at December 31, 2015, we had a total of $39.1 billion in mortgages and
   loans, representing 28.3% of our total invested assets, compared to
   $33.7 billion representing 26.9% as at December 31, 2014. Our mortgage
   portfolio consisted almost entirely of first mortgages, and our
   corporate loan portfolio consisted of private placement assets.

   The carrying value of mortgages and loans by geographic location is
   presented in the following table.^(1)

   ^(1) ^The geographic location for mortgages is based on the location of
        the property and for loans it is
        ^based on the country of the creditor's parent.

   As at December 31, 2015, we held $14.8 billion of mortgages, compared
   to $13.4 billion as at December 31, 2014. Our mortgage portfolio
   consists entirely of commercial mortgages, including retail, office,
   multi-family, industrial and land properties. As at December 31, 2015,
   24.8% of our commercial mortgage portfolio consisted of multi-family
   residential mortgages. Our uninsured commercial portfolio had a
   weighted average loan-to-value ratio of approximately 55% as at
   December 31, 2015, compared to approximately 54% as at December 31,
   2014. While we generally require a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 75%
   at issuance, we may invest in mortgages with a higher loan-to-value
   ratio in Canada if the mortgage is insured. The estimated weighted
   average debt service coverage for our uninsured commercial portfolio is
   1.73 times. Of the loans in the Canadian commercial mortgage portfolio,
   31.0% were insured by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.

   As at December 31, 2015, we held $24.3 billion of corporate loans,
   compared to $20.3 billion as at December 31, 2014. In the current low
   interest rate environment, our strategy is to continue to focus our
   efforts on the origination of new private placement assets. Private
   placement assets provide diversification by type of loan, industry
   segment and borrower credit quality. The loan portfolio consists of
   senior secured and unsecured loans to large- and mid-market sized
   corporate borrowers, securitized lease/loan obligations secured by a
   variety of assets, and project finance loans in sectors such as power
   and infrastructure.

        2015 and $18 million of sectoral provisions as at December 31, 2014.

   Our impaired mortgages and loans, net of allowance for losses, were $95
   million as at December 31, 2015, compared to $101 million as at
   December 31, 2014. The majority of impaired mortgages are in the United
   States.

   Asset Default Provision
   We make provisions for possible future credit events in the
   determination of our insurance contract liabilities. The amount of the
   provision for asset default included in insurance contract liabilities
   is based on possible reductions in future investment yields that vary
   by factors such as type of asset, asset credit quality (rating),
   duration and country of origin. To the extent that an asset is written
   off, or disposed of, any amounts that were set aside in our insurance
   contract liabilities for possible future asset defaults in respect of
   that asset are released.

   Our asset default provision reflects the provision relating to future
   credit events for fixed income assets currently held by the Company
   that support our insurance contract liabilities. Our asset default
   provision as at December 31, 2015 was $2,077 million compared to $1,916
   million as at December 31, 2014. The increase of $161 million was
   primarily due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar and increases in
   the provision for assets purchased net of dispositions, partially
   offset by the release of provisions on fixed income assets supporting
   our insurance contract liabilities.

   The values associated with our derivative instruments are presented in
   the following table. Notional amounts serve as the basis for payments
   calculated under derivatives contracts and are not exchanged.

   Derivative Instruments


   ($ millions)                           December 31, 2015   December 31, 2014
   Net fair value                                  (1,512)                  236
   Total notional amount                            57,845               48,211
   Credit equivalent amount                            607                  738
   Risk-weighted credit equivalent amount                7                    7

   The total notional amount of our derivatives increased to $57.8 billion
   as at December 31, 2015 from $48.2 billion as at December 31, 2014. The
   increase in the total notional amount was primarily due to an increase
   of $5.9 billion in interest rate contracts for duration matching
   activities and an increase of $0.9 billion in currency contracts
   hedging foreign currency assets. The notional amount of derivatives
   increased a further $2.0 billion due to the conversion of foreign
   currency notional balances into Canadian dollars.

   The net fair value of derivatives was a net liability of $1,512 million
   as at December 31, 2015 compared to a net asset of $236 million as at
   December 31, 2014. The decrease in net fair value was due primarily to
   the impact of the weakening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S.
   dollar on foreign exchange contracts.

   Capital Management
   Our total capital consists of subordinated debt and other capital,
   participating policyholders' equity and total shareholders' equity
   which includes common shareholders' equity and preferred shareholders'
   equity. As at December 31, 2015, our total capital was $24.6 billion,
   up from $21.7 billion as at December 31, 2014. The increase in total
   capital was primarily the result of common shareholders' net income of
   $2,185 million, other comprehensive income of $1,295 million, and the
   issuance of $500 million of subordinated debentures, partially offset
   by the $830 million of dividends on common shares (net of the Canadian
   dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan), $212 million of common
   share purchases under our normal course issuer bid, and redemption of
   US$150 million of subordinated debentures.

   The legal entity, SLF Inc. (the ultimate parent company), and its
   wholly owned holding companies had $990 million in cash and other
   liquid assets as at December 31, 2015 ($1,827 million as at
   December 31, 2014). The decrease in cash and liquid assets in 2015 was
   primarily attributable to the acquisitions during 2015, including the
   purchase of $1,250 million of Sun Life Assurance preferred shares in
   connection with the funding of the pending acquisition of Assurant EB,
   as well as other operating and financing activities. Liquid assets as
   noted above, include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments,
   and publicly traded securities.

   On June 30, 2015, 6.0 million Class A Non-Cumulative 5-Year Rate Reset
   Preferred Shares Series 8R of SLF Inc. ("Series 8R Shares") were
   converted into Class A Non-Cumulative Floating Rate Preferred Shares
   Series 9QR of SLF Inc. ("Series 9QR Shares") through a shareholder
   option, on a one-for-one basis. After the conversion, 5.2 million
   Series 8R Shares and 6.0 million Series 9QR Shares were outstanding.
   For additional information, refer to Note 16 in our Annual Consolidated
   Financial Statements.

   On September 25, 2015, SLF Inc. issued $500 million principal amount of
   Series 2015-1 Subordinated Unsecured 2.60% Fixed/Floating Debentures
   due 2025. The net proceeds will be used to partially fund the
   acquisition of Assurant EB and may also be used for general corporate
   purposes.

   On November 23, 2015, SLF Inc. redeemed all of the outstanding $600
   million principal amount of Series A Senior Unsecured 4.80%
   Fixed/Floating Debentures ("the Series A Senior Debentures") due 2035
   in accordance with the terms of the Series A Senior Debentures.

   On December 15, 2015, the US$150 million principal amount of
   Subordinated Unsecured 7.25% Debentures due 2015 issued by Sun Canada
   Financial Company matured and was repaid.

   On November 10, 2014, SLF Inc. launched a normal course issuer bid
   under which it was authorized to purchase up to 9 million common shares
   between November 10, 2014 and November 9, 2015, and subsequently the
   normal course issuer bid was not renewed. During 2015, SLF Inc.
   purchased and cancelled 5.3 million common shares at a total cost of
   $212 million. During the fourth quarter of 2014, SLF Inc. repurchased
   and cancelled approximately 1 million common shares at a total cost of
   $39 million under this share repurchase program.

   Dividends payable to participants in the Canadian Dividend Reinvestment
   and Share Purchase Plan are used to purchase common shares either from
   treasury or in the open market, at our discretion. Commencing with the
   dividends payable on March 31, 2016 and until further notice, common
   shares purchased under the Plan will be purchased on the open market.

   Sun Life Assurance's MCCSR ratio was 240% as at December 31, 2015,
   which includes the issuance of $1,250 million of preferred shares by
   Sun Life Assurance to SLF Inc. in connection with the funding of the
   pending acquisition of Assurant EB, compared to 217% as at December 31,
   2014. Excluding this impact, the increase in the MCCSR ratio over the
   period primarily results from earnings net of dividends to SLF Inc.,
   partially offset by capital used to support new business and the impact
   of a partial recapture of a reinsurance arrangement.

   Risk Management
   We have established a Risk Management Framework to assist in
   identifying, measuring, managing, monitoring and reporting of risks.
   The Risk Management Framework covers all risks and these have been
   grouped into six major categories: credit, market, insurance, business
   and strategic, operational and liquidity risks.

   Through our enterprise risk management processes, we oversee the
   various risk factors identified in the Risk Management Framework and
   provide reports to senior management and to the Board Committees at
   least quarterly. Our enterprise risk management processes and risk
   factors are described in our annual MD&A and AIF.

   When referring to segregated funds in this section, it is inclusive of
   segregated fund guarantees, variable annuities and investment products
   and includes Run-off reinsurance in our Corporate business segment.

   Market Risk Sensitivities
   Our earnings are affected by the determination of policyholder
   obligations under our annuity and insurance contracts. These amounts
   are determined using internal valuation models and are recorded in our
   Annual Consolidated Financial Statements, primarily as Insurance
   contract liabilities. The determination of these obligations requires
   management to make assumptions about the future level of equity market
   performance, interest rates, credit and swap spreads and other factors
   over the life of our products. Differences between our actual
   experience and our best estimate assumptions are reflected in our
   Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to the section
   Additional Cautionary Language and Key Assumptions Related to
   Sensitivities for important additional information regarding these
   estimates.

   The market value of our investments in fixed income and equity
   securities fluctuates based on movements in interest rates and equity
   markets. The market value of fixed income assets designated as AFS that
   are held primarily in our surplus segment increases (decreases) with
   declining (rising) interest rates. The market value of equities
   designated as AFS and held primarily in our surplus segment increases
   (decreases) with rising (declining) equity markets. Changes in the
   market value of AFS assets flow through OCI and are only recognized in
   net income when realized upon sale, or when considered impaired. The
   amount of realized gains (losses) recorded in net income in any period
   is equal to the unrealized gains (losses) or OCI position at the start
   of the period plus the change in market value during the current period
   up to the point of sale for those securities that were sold during the
   period. The sale or impairment of AFS assets held in surplus can
   therefore have the effect of modifying our net income sensitivity.

   We realized $39 million (pre-tax) in net gains on the sale of AFS
   assets during the fourth quarter of 2015 and $228 million (pre-tax) in
   2015 ($49 million pre-tax in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $202
   million pre-tax in 2014). The net unrealized gains or OCI position on
   AFS fixed income and equity assets were $53 million and $197 million,
   respectively, after-tax as at December 31, 2015 ($340 million and $208
   million, respectively, after-tax as at December 31, 2014).

   The following table sets out the estimated immediate impact on, or
   sensitivity of our net income, our OCI, and Sun Life Assurance's MCCSR
   ratio to certain instantaneous changes in interest rates and equity
   market prices as at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.

   ^(1) ^Net income and OCI sensitivities have been rounded to the nearest
   $50 million. The sensitivities exclude the market impacts on the income
   from our joint ventures and associates, which we account for on an
   equity basis.
   ^(2) ^Interest rate sensitivities assume a parallel shift in assumed
   interest rates across the entire yield curve as at December 31, 2015
   and December 31, 2014. Variations in realized yields based on factors
   such as different terms to maturity and geographies may result in
   realized sensitivities being significantly different from those
   illustrated above. Sensitivities include the impact of re-balancing
   interest rate hedges for dynamic hedging programs at 10 basis point
   intervals (for 50 basis point changes in interest rates) and at 20
   basis point intervals (for 100 basis point changes in interest rates).
   ^(3) ^The market risk sensitivities include the estimated mitigation
   impact of our hedging programs in effect as at December 31, 2015 and
   December 31, 2014, and include new business added and product changes
   implemented prior to such dates.
   ^(4) ^The MCCSR sensitivities illustrate the impact on Sun Life
   Assurance as at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. This excludes
   the impact on assets and liabilities that are in SLF Inc. but not
   included in Sun Life Assurance. MCCSR sensitivities as at December 31,
   2014 reflect the impact of IAS 19 Employee Benefits and its phase-in
   impact on available capital.
   ^(5) ^Represents the respective change across all equity markets as at
   December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Assumes that actual equity
   exposures consistently and precisely track the broader equity markets.
   Since in actual practice equity-related exposures generally differ from
   broad market indices (due to the impact of active management, basis
   risk and other factors), realized sensitivities may differ
   significantly from those illustrated above. Sensitivities include the
   impact of re-balancing equity hedges for dynamic hedging programs at 2%
   intervals (for 10% changes in equity markets) and at 5% intervals (for
   25% changes in equity markets).
   ^(6) ^The majority of interest rate sensitivity, after hedging, is
   attributed to individual insurance products. We also have interest rate
   sensitivity, after hedging, from our fixed annuity and segregated funds
   products.

   Our net income sensitivities to interest rates and equity markets have
   changed since December 31, 2014. This is primarily as a result of
   changes in measurement of sensitivities related to assumption changes
   and management actions.

   Credit Spread and Swap Spread Sensitivities
   We have estimated the immediate impact or sensitivity of our
   shareholder net income attributable to certain instantaneous changes in
   credit and swap spreads. The credit spread sensitivities reflect the
   impact of changes in credit spreads on our asset and liability
   valuations (including non-sovereign fixed income assets, provincial
   governments, corporate bonds and other fixed income assets). The swap
   spread sensitivities reflect the impact of changes in swap spreads on
   swap-based derivative positions and liability valuations.

   The credit and swap spread sensitivities assume a parallel shift in the
   indicated spreads across the entire term structure. Variations in
   realized spread changes based on different terms to maturity,
   geographies, asset classes and derivative types, underlying interest
   rate movements, and ratings may result in realized sensitivities being
   significantly different from those provided above. The credit spread
   sensitivity estimates exclude any credit spread impact that may arise
   in connection with asset positions held in segregated funds. Spread
   sensitivities are provided for the consolidated entity and may not be
   proportional across all reporting segments. Refer to the section
   Additional Cautionary Language and Key Assumptions Related to
   Sensitivities for important additional information regarding these
   estimates.

   General Account Insurance and Annuity Products
   Most of our expected sensitivity to changes in interest rates and about
   two-thirds of our expected sensitivity to changes in equity markets are
   derived from our general account insurance and annuity products. We
   have implemented market risk management strategies to mitigate a
   portion of the market risk related to our general account insurance and
   annuity products.

   Individual insurance products include universal life and other
   long-term life and health insurance products. Major sources of market
   risk exposure for individual insurance products include the
   reinvestment risk related to future premiums on regular premium
   policies, asset reinvestment risk on both regular premium and single
   premium policies and the guaranteed cost of insurance. Interest rate
   risk for individual insurance products is typically managed on a
   duration basis, within tolerance ranges set out in the applicable
   investment policy or guidelines. Targets and limits are established so
   that the level of residual exposure is commensurate with our risk
   appetite. Exposures are monitored frequently, and assets are
   re-balanced as necessary to maintain compliance within policy limits
   using a combination of assets and derivative instruments. A portion of
   the longer-term cash flows are backed with equities and real estate.

   For participating insurance products and other insurance products with
   adjustability features, the investment strategy objective is to provide
   a total rate of return given a constant risk profile over the long
   term.

   Fixed annuity products generally provide the policyholder with a
   guaranteed investment return or crediting rate. Interest rate risk for
   these products is typically managed on a duration basis, within
   tolerance ranges set out in the applicable investment guidelines.
   Targets and limits are established such that the level of residual
   exposure is commensurate with our risk appetite. Exposures are
   monitored frequently, and are re-balanced as necessary to maintain
   compliance within prescribed tolerances using a combination of fixed
   income assets and derivative instruments.

   Certain insurance and annuity products contain minimum interest rate
   guarantees. Market risk management strategies are implemented to limit
   potential financial loss due to reductions in asset earned rates
   relative to contract guarantees. These typically involve the use of
   hedging strategies utilizing interest rate derivatives such as interest
   rate floors, swaps and swaptions.

   Certain insurance and annuity products contain features which allow the
   policyholders to surrender their policy at book value. Market risk
   management strategies are implemented to limit the potential financial
   loss due to changes in interest rate levels and policyholder behaviour.
   These typically involve the use of hedging strategies such as dynamic
   option replication and the purchase of interest rate swaptions.

   Certain products have guaranteed minimum annuitization rates. Market
   risk management strategies are implemented to limit the potential
   financial loss and typically involve the use of fixed income assets,
   interest rate swaps and swaptions.

   Segregated Fund Guarantees
   Approximately one-third of our equity market sensitivity and a small
   amount of interest rate risk sensitivity as at December 31, 2015 are
   derived from segregated fund products. These products provide benefit
   guarantees, which are linked to underlying fund performance and may be
   triggered upon death, maturity, withdrawal or annuitization. The cost
   of providing these guarantees is uncertain and depends upon a number of
   factors including general capital market conditions, our hedging
   strategies, policyholder behaviour and mortality experience, each of
   which may result in negative impacts on net income and capital.

   The following table provides information with respect to the guarantees
   provided for our segregated fund products.

  ^(1)   ^The Amount at Risk represents the excess of the value of the
         guarantees over fund values on all policies where the value of the
         guarantees exceeds the fund value. The Amount at Risk is not currently
         payable as the guarantees are only payable upon death, maturity,
         withdrawal or annuitization if fund values remain below guaranteed
         values.
  ^(2)   ^For guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits, the value of
         guarantees is calculated as the present value of the maximum future
         withdrawals assuming market conditions remain unchanged from current
         levels. For all other benefits, the value of guarantees is determined
         assuming 100% of the claims are made at the valuation date.
  ^(3)   ^The insurance contract liabilities represent management's
         provision for future costs associated with these guarantees and include
         a provision for adverse deviation in accordance with Canadian actuarial
         standards of practice.
  ^(4)   ^The Run-off reinsurance business includes risks assumed through
         reinsurance of variable annuity products issued by various North
         American insurance companies between 1997 and 2001. This line of
         business is part of a closed block of reinsurance, which is included in
         the Corporate segment.

   The movement of the items in the table above from December 31, 2014 to
   December 31, 2015 was primarily as a result of the following factors:

  (i)     the total fund values decreased due to the natural run-off of the
          block net of new sales and unfavourable equity market movements,
          partially offset by the weakening of the Canadian dollar against the
          U.S. dollar;
  (ii)    the amount at risk increased primarily due to unfavourable
          equity market movements and the weakening of the Canadian dollar;
  (iii)   the total value of guarantees increased due to the weakening of
          the Canadian dollar, partially offset by the natural run-off of the
          block net of new sales; and
  (iv)    the total insurance contract liabilities increased due to lower
          interest rates, unfavourable equity movements and the weakening of the
          Canadian dollar.

   Segregated Fund Hedging
   Our hedging programs use derivative instruments to mitigate the
   interest and equity related exposure of our segregated fund contracts.
   As at December 31, 2015, over 90% of our segregated fund contracts, as
   measured by associated fund values, were included in a hedging program.
   While a large percentage of contracts are included in the hedging
   program, not all of our market risk exposure related to these contracts
   is hedged. For those segregated fund contracts included in the hedging
   program, we generally hedge the value of expected future net claims
   costs and associated margins.

   The following table illustrates the impact of our hedging program
   related to our sensitivity to a 50 basis point and 100 basis point
   decrease in interest rates and a 10% and 25% decrease in equity markets
   for segregated fund contracts as at December 31, 2015 and December 31,
   2014.

  ^(2)   ^Since the fair value of benefits being hedged will generally
         differ from the financial statement value (due to different valuation
         methods and the inclusion of valuation margins in respect of financial
         statement values), this will result in residual volatility to interest
         rate and equity market shocks in reported income and capital. The
         general availability and cost of these hedging instruments may be
         adversely impacted by a number of factors, including volatile and
         declining equity and interest rate market conditions.
  ^(3)   ^Represents a parallel shift in assumed interest rates across

         to maturity and geographies may result in realized sensitivities being
         significantly different from those illustrated above. Sensitivities
         include the impact of re-balancing interest rate hedges for dynamic
         hedging programs at 10 basis point intervals (for 50 basis point

         Since in actual practice, equity-related exposures generally differ
         from broad market indices (due to the impact of active management,
         basis risk and other factors), realized sensitivities may differ
         significantly from those illustrated above. Sensitivities include the
         impact of re-balancing equity hedges for dynamic hedging programs at 2%
         intervals (for 10% changes in equity markets) and at 5% intervals (for
         25% changes in equity markets).

   Real Estate Risk
   Real estate risk is the potential for financial loss arising from
   fluctuations in the value of, or future cash flows from, our
   investments in real estate. We are exposed to real estate risk arising
   from fluctuations in the value of, or future cash flows on, real estate
   classified as investment properties. We may experience financial losses
   resulting from the direct ownership of real estate investments or
   indirectly through fixed income investments secured by real estate
   property, leasehold interests, ground rents, and purchase and leaseback
   transactions. Real estate price risk may arise from external market
   conditions, inadequate property analysis, inadequate insurance
   coverage, inappropriate real estate appraisals or from environmental
   risk exposures. We hold direct real estate investments that support
   general account liabilities and surplus, and fluctuations in value will
   impact our profitability and financial position. A material and
   sustained increase in interest rates may lead to deterioration in North
   American real estate values. An instantaneous 10% decrease in the value
   of our direct real estate investments as at December 31, 2015 would
   decrease net income by approximately $175 million ($150 million
   decrease as at December 31, 2014). Conversely, an instantaneous 10%
   increase in the value of our direct real estate investments as at
   December 31, 2015 would increase net income by approximately $175
   million ($150 million increase as at December 31, 2014).

   Additional Cautionary Language and Key Assumptions Related to
   Sensitivities
   Our market risk sensitivities are measures of our estimated change in
   net income and OCI for changes in interest rates and equity market
   price levels described above, based on interest rates, equity market
   prices and business mix in place as at the respective calculation
   dates. These sensitivities are calculated independently for each risk
   factor, generally assuming that all other risk variables stay constant.
   The sensitivities do not take into account indirect effects such as
   potential impacts on goodwill impairment or valuation allowances on
   deferred tax assets. The sensitivities are provided for the
   consolidated entity and may not be proportional across all reporting
   segments. Actual results can differ materially from these estimates for
   a variety of reasons, including differences in the pattern or
   distribution of the market shocks, the interaction between these risk
   factors, model error, or changes in other assumptions such as business
   mix, effective tax rates, policyholder behaviour, currency exchange
   rates and other market variables relative to those underlying the
   calculation of these sensitivities. The extent to which actual results
   may differ from the indicative ranges will generally increase with
   larger capital market movements. Our sensitivities as at December 31,
   2014 have been included for comparative purposes only.

   We have also provided measures of our net income sensitivity to
   instantaneous changes in credit spreads, swap spreads, real estate
   price levels and capital sensitivities to changes in interest rates and
   equity price levels. The real estate sensitivities are non-IFRS
   financial measures. For additional information, see Use of Non-IFRS
   Financial Measures. The cautionary language which appears in this
   section is also applicable to the credit spread, swap spread, real
   estate and MCCSR ratio sensitivities. In particular, these
   sensitivities are based on interest rates, credit and swap spreads,
   equity market and real estate price levels as at the respective
   calculation dates and assume that all other risk variables remain
   constant. Changes in interest rates, credit and swap spreads, equity
   market and real estate prices in excess of the ranges illustrated may
   result in other-than-proportionate impacts.

   As these market risk sensitivities reflect an instantaneous impact on
   net income, OCI and Sun Life Assurance's MCCSR ratio, they do not
   include impacts over time such as the effect on fee income in our asset
   management businesses.

   The sensitivities reflect the composition of our assets and liabilities
   as at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Changes in
   these positions due to new sales or maturities, asset purchases/sales
   or other management actions could result in material changes to these
   reported sensitivities. In particular, these sensitivities reflect the
   expected impact of hedging activities based on the hedge programs in
   place as at the December 31 calculation dates. The actual impact of
   these hedging activities can differ materially from that assumed in the
   determination of these indicative sensitivities due to ongoing hedge
   re-balancing activities, changes in the scale or scope of hedging
   activities, changes in the cost or general availability of hedging
   instruments, basis risk (i.e., the risk that hedges do not exactly
   replicate the underlying portfolio experience), model risk and other
   operational risks in the ongoing management of the hedge programs or
   the potential failure of hedge counterparties to perform in accordance
   with expectations.

   The sensitivities are based on methods and assumptions in effect as at
   December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, as applicable. Changes in the
   regulatory environment, accounting or actuarial valuation methods,
   models, or assumptions after those dates could result in material
   changes to these reported sensitivities. Changes in interest rates and
   equity market prices in excess of the ranges illustrated may result in
   other than proportionate impacts.

   Our hedging programs may themselves expose us to other risks, including
   basis risk (i.e., the risk that hedges do not exactly replicate the
   underlying portfolio experience), derivative counterparty credit risk,
   and increased levels of liquidity risk, model risk and other
   operational risks. These factors may adversely impact the net
   effectiveness, costs, and financial viability of maintaining these
   hedging programs and therefore adversely impact our profitability and
   financial position. While our hedging programs are intended to mitigate
   these effects (e.g., hedge counterparty credit risk is managed by
   maintaining broad diversification, dealing primarily with highly rated
   counterparties, and transacting through International Swaps and
   Derivatives Association agreements that generally include applicable
   credit support annexes), residual risk, potential reported earnings and
   capital volatility remain.

   For the reasons outlined above, our sensitivities should only be viewed
   as directional estimates of the underlying sensitivities of each factor
   under these specialized assumptions, and should not be viewed as
   predictors of our future net income, OCI, and capital sensitivities.
   Given the nature of these calculations, we cannot provide assurance
   that actual impact will be consistent with the estimates provided.

   Information related to market risk sensitivities and guarantees related
   to segregated fund products should be read in conjunction with the
   information contained in the sections in the annual MD&A under the
   headings Outlook and Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.
   Additional information on market risk can be found in Note 6 of our
   2015 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and the Risk Factors
   section in our AIF.

   Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Financial Measures
   Additional information on the use of non-IFRS measures, including the
   definition of operating net income (loss) and underlying net income
   (loss), is available in this document under the heading Use of Non-IFRS
   Financial Measures.

   The following table sets out the amounts that were excluded from our
   operating net income (loss), underlying net income (loss), operating
   EPS and underlying EPS, and provides a reconciliation to our reported
   net income (loss) and EPS based on IFRS.

   ^(1) ^Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, we renamed the operating
        adjustment Acquisition, integration and restructuring costs from
        Restructuring and other related costs to accommodate acquisition and
        integration adjustments arising from our 2015 activities.

   Management also uses the following non-IFRS financial measures:

   Return on equity. IFRS does not prescribe the calculation of ROE and
   therefore a comparable measure under IFRS is not available. To
   determine operating ROE and underlying ROE, operating net income (loss)
   and underlying net income (loss) are divided by the total weighted
   average common shareholders' equity for the period, respectively.

   Adjusted revenue. This measure excludes from revenue the impact of: (i)
   exchange rate fluctuations, from the translation of functional
   currencies to the Canadian dollar, for comparisons ("Constant Currency
   Adjustment"); (ii) Fair value and foreign currency changes on assets
   and liabilities ("FV Adjustment"); and (iii) reinsurance for the
   insured business in SLF Canada's GB operations ("Reinsurance in SLF
   Canada's GB Operations Adjustment"). Adjusted revenue is an alternative
   measure of revenue that provides greater comparability across reporting
   periods.

   Adjusted premiums and deposits. This measure adjusts premiums and
   deposits for the impact of: (i) the Constant Currency Adjustment and
   (ii) the Reinsurance in SLF Canada's GB Operations Adjustment. Adjusted
   premiums and deposits is an alternative measure of premiums and
   deposits that provides greater comparability across reporting periods.

   MFS pre-tax operating profit margin ratio. This ratio is a measure of
   the underlying profitability of MFS, which excludes the impact of fair
   value adjustments on MFS's share-based payment awards, investment
   income, and certain commission expenses that are offsetting. These
   amounts are excluded in order to neutralize the impact these items have
   on the pre-tax operating profit margin ratio and have no impact on the
   underlying profitability of MFS.

   Impact of foreign exchange. Several financial measures are presented on
   a constant currency adjusted basis to exclude the impact of foreign
   exchange rate fluctuations. These measures are calculated using the
   average or period end foreign exchange rates, as appropriate, in effect
   at the date of the comparative period.

   Real estate market sensitivities. Real estate market sensitivities are
   non-IFRS financial measures, for which there are no directly comparable
   measures under IFRS so it is not possible to provide a reconciliation
   of these amounts to the most directly comparable IFRS measures.

   Other. Management also uses the following non-IFRS financial measures
   for which there are no comparable financial measures in IFRS: (i) ASO
   premium and deposit equivalents, mutual fund sales, managed fund sales,
   life and health sales, and total premiums and deposits; (ii) AUM,
   mutual fund assets, managed fund assets, other AUM and assets under
   administration; (iii) the value of new business, which is used to
   measure the estimated lifetime profitability of new sales and is based
   on actuarial calculations; and (iv) assumption changes and management
   actions, which is a component of our sources of earnings disclosure.
   Sources of earnings is an alternative presentation of our Consolidated
   Statements of Operations that identifies and quantifies various sources
   of income. The Company is required to disclose its sources of earnings
   by its principal regulator, the Office of the Superintendent of
   Financial Institutions.

   Forward-looking Statements
   From time to time, the Company makes written or oral forward-looking
   statements within the meaning of certain securities laws, including the
   "safe harbour" provisions of the United States Private Securities
   Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and applicable Canadian securities
   legislation. Forward-looking statements contained in this document
   include (i) statements relating to the anticipated source of funding
   for the acquisition of Assurant EB and the timing of receipt of
   regulatory approvals and closing for that transaction,  (ii) statements
   relating to our growth strategies,(iii) statements relating to
   productivity and expense initiatives, growth initiatives and other
   business objectives, (iv) statements that are predictive in nature or
   that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, and (v)
   statements that include words such as "aim", "anticipate",
   "assumption", "believe", "could", "estimate", "expect", "goal",
   "initiatives", "intend", "may", "objective", "outlook", "plan",
   "project", "seek", "should", "strategy", "strive", "target", "will" and
   similar expressions are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
   statements include the information concerning our possible or assumed
   future results of operations. These statements represent our current
   expectations, estimates and projections regarding future events and are
   not historical facts. Forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of
   future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that are
   difficult to predict. Future results and shareholder value may differ
   materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements due
   to, among other factors, the matters set out in this document under the
   headings Capital Management and Risk Management, and in SLF Inc.'s most
   recent AIF under the heading Risk Factors, and the factors detailed in
   SLF Inc.'s other filings with Canadian and U.S. securities regulators,
   which are available for review at [59]www.sedar.com and
   [60]www.sec.gov.

   Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
   expectations include, but are not limited to: credit risks - related to
   issuers of securities held in our investment portfolio, debtors,
   structured securities, reinsurers, counterparties, other financial
   institutions and other entities; market risks - related to the
   performance of equity markets; changes or volatility in interest rates
   or credit spreads or swap spreads; real estate investments; and
   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; insurance risks -
   related to mortality, morbidity, longevity and policyholder behaviour;
   product design and pricing; the impact of higher-than-expected future
   expenses; and the availability, cost and effectiveness of reinsurance;
   business and strategic risks - related to global economic and political
   conditions; changes in distribution channels or customer behaviour
   including risks relating to market conduct by intermediaries and
   agents; changes in the competitive, legal or regulatory environment,
   including capital requirements and tax laws; tax matters, including
   estimates and judgments used in calculating taxes; the design and
   implementation of business strategies; the performance of our
   investments and investment portfolios managed for clients such as
   segregated and mutual funds; our international operations, including
   our joint ventures; market conditions that affect our capital position
   or ability to raise capital; downgrades in financial strength or credit
   ratings; and the impact of mergers, acquisitions and divestitures;
   operational risks - related to breaches or failure of information
   system security and privacy, including cyber-attacks; our ability to
   attract and retain employees; the execution and integration of mergers,
   acquisitions and divestitures; legal, regulatory compliance and market
   conduct, including the impact of regulatory inquiries and
   investigations; our information technology infrastructure; a failure of
   information systems and Internet-enabled technology; dependence on
   third-party relationships, including outsourcing arrangements; business
   continuity; model errors; information management; the environment,
   environmental laws and regulations and third-party policies; and
   liquidity risks - the possibility that we will not be able to fund all
   cash outflow commitments as they fall due.

   The following risk factors are related to our pending acquisition of
   Assurant EB and could have a material adverse effect on our financial
   results: (i) ability to complete the transaction as planned, including
   the separation and integration of the transferred business; (ii)
   failure of the parties to obtain necessary consents and approvals
   required under the definitive agreement or to otherwise satisfy the
   conditions to the completion of the transaction in a timely manner, or
   at all; (iii) our ability to realize the financial and strategic
   benefits of the transaction; (iv) failure to effectively or efficiently
   restructure and reorganize our U.S. employee benefits business after
   the transaction has closed; and (v) the impact of the dedication of our
   resources to the completion of the transaction and integration of the
   business and the effect the transaction may have on our continuing
   operations in the U.S. These risks all could have an impact on our
   business relationships (including with future and prospective
   employees, customers, distributors and partners) and could have a
   material adverse effect on our current and future operations, financial
   conditions and prospects.

   The Company does not undertake any obligation to update or revise its
   forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the
   date of this document or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated
   events, except as required by law.

University bosses' pay 'inflation-busting'

   By Katherine Sellgren BBC News education reporter
     * 11 February 2016
     * From the section [62]Education & Family

   accused of high living, while lecturers face limits on pay

   Vice-chancellors at UK universities received average salary packages of
   £272,000 last year - up by some £12,000 on the previous year, a study
   suggests.

   The University and College Union research indicated universities spent
   thousands more on hotels, flights and other expenses for
   vice-chancellors.

   The UCU says staff pay is held down but bosses get "inflation-busting"
   rises.

   Universities UK said the pay of bosses was in line with similarly sized
   public and private organisations.

   The UCU used Freedom of Information requests to ask UK universities and
   colleges questions about vice-chancellors' pay deals, including
   benefits and pensions, for the year 2014-15.

   The union also asked about money paid out for air fares, hotel
   accommodation and personal expenses.

   vice-chancellors claimed in air fares

   The findings suggest the average overall salary package for university
   heads in 2014-15 was £272,432 (based on figures from 152 institutions)
   - up from £260,290 in 2013-14 (based on figures from 150 institutions).

   The [63]report also suggests:
     * Average expenditure on flights was £8,560.37
     * 50% were first or business class
     * 21 university leaders flew exclusively in these two classes
     * Strathclyde University spent the most on flights, £41,891 for Prof
       Sir Jim McDonald
     * Average expenditure on hotels was £2,989.93 (based on figures from
       128 institutions)
     * Glasgow Caledonian University spent the most on hotels, £19,864.77
       for Prof Pamela Gillies
     * Former Oxford chief Prof Andrew Hamilton was the highest paid, with
       a package, including benefits and pension contributions, of
       £462,000

   Eighteen of the 159 institutions contacted did not respond to the
   Freedom of Information request.

   for better pay and terms and conditions for lecturers

   A Universities UK representative said: "The remuneration packages of
   vice-chancellors are determined by independent remuneration committees
   at each individual institution and are publicly available in
   universities' annual reports and accounts.

   "The salaries of university leaders in the UK are in line with those in
   competitor countries and comparable to similarly sized public and
   private organisations."

   A spokesman for Oxford University said the institution was consistently
   ranked as one of the best in the world.

   "Its research output is vast, it has more than £1bn a year in turnover,
   not including the colleges and Oxford University Press, and it has
   great institutional complexity," he said.

   "The vice-chancellor's salary reflects that."

   its vice-chancellor's pay levels

   A spokesman for Glasgow Caledonian University said Prof Gillies
   "maximises the value of each business trip by fulfilling a full
   schedule of engagements".

   "GCU is transparent in reporting costs incurred, and Prof Gillies's
   travel and accommodation costs are subject to scrutiny by independent
   governors on the university court."

   A University of Strathclyde spokesman said: "The principal is a global
   ambassador for the university, and forging links with international
   institutions, academic partners and industrial collaborators is an
   essential part of his role."

   But UCU general secretary Sally Hunt said: "The time has finally come
   for a frank and open discussion about pay and transparency in higher
   education.

   "The huge disparities in the levels of pay and pay rises at the top
   expose the arbitrary nature of senior pay in our universities.

   "While some continue to enjoy inflation-busting pay hikes and all the
   trimmings of first-class flights and luxury hotels, staff pay continues
   to be held down.

   "We will continue to campaign for a proper register of pay and perks at
   the top of our universities."

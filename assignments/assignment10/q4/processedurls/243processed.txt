'11.22.63.' Showrunner Bridget Carpenter on Wrangling James Franco and
Trimming Stephen King

   Premiering on President's Day, the eight-part miniseries 11.22.63 is
   Hulu's most ambitious original programming swing to date. The
   adaptation of Stephen King's acclaimed time travel novel features James
   Franco as a teacher who journeys back to 1960 on a three-year mission
   to prevent JFK's assassination, making stops along the way to follow
   Lee Harvey Oswald and fall in love.

   While the success of franchises with the word "star" in the title
   guaranteed that executive producer J.J. Abrams' name is being pushed
   front-and-center in promotion for 11.22.63, the actual showrunner is
   Bridget Carpenter, a veteran of Friday Night Lights and Parenthood.

   In a far-reaching conversation, The Hollywood Reporter spoke with
   Carpenter about distilling King's mammoth tome down to a relatively
   restrained series length, the logistical advantages of working with the
   project's big names and the challenges and pleasures of working with
   one of Hollywood's busiest stars in Franco.

   The first part of this interview focuses on general issues of 11.22.63
   development, including Carpenter's perspective on the past, Hulu
   selling thriller sizzle over the series' romantic streak and why she
   wouldn't do well on her own time-traveling mission.

   Career Move He (Almost) Regrets

   Check back tomorrow for the second part of the interview, which talks
   specifically about changes from the book.

   What are a couple of your favorite Stephen King screen adaptations?

   For me, the one is Misery. I love Misery. Probably because it's a
   writer suffering. I like The Shining, although I like the book much
   more and I know Stephen hates The Shining. I actually understand why,
   because he's like, "They're not even people! You don't recognize them
   as people!" And I'm like, "Yeah, that's what makes it really
   scary!" Stand By Me is really fantastic. It holds its own and it's a
   great story. Of course Shawshank is excellent, excellent. I like The
   Green Mile too.

   Except that it's eighteen hours long.

   Yes! Yeah, although I can't speak to that because I was like, "No, no,
   we need more time." But Misery is the number one adaptation for me.

   When you have something like 11/22/63 and it's this gigantic doorstop
   of a tome, how do you look at how huge that book is and know which
   parts of the story need to be told for the purposes of screen?

   I have such an elementary way of going about it. I had read the book
   just for fun. I had read the book before I was ever called to discuss
   adapting it so I knew it quite well. I started reading it again and
   now, of course, I've read it many, many dozens of times. I start by
   just doing as much from memory as I can because I think the book is so
   emblazoned on my mind that I start writing down the scenes that I can't
   wait to write. It's sort of love and passion. I'm like "Oh my God, oh
   my God, that scene!" I'm an index-carder. I put up index cards and I
   try to do everything, as much from memory, from top to bottom as I can.
   Then I start going back — sort of seeing then how my memory of what the
   story is has informed how it breaks down.

   So then is the assumption that if you don't remember something all that
   vividly as a reader that probably that means you don't need to see it
   on screen?

   Possibly, although I wish it were that black and white because my
   memory is not so good that I was like, "Great, I wrote down everything
   I remembered and now I've got my miniseries!" No, because then you go
   back and you go, "Oh, I did forget about that moment," and it's really
   useful and important. But it's more about... writing about what's
   exciting. Because then I naturally lean into what the peak of maybe
   excitement or big pieces are that are sort of defining moments.

   In fact I will say, early on I made a pitch to cut out a pretty
   significant part of the front of the book because I went, "We've got to
   get to 11/22. I've just got to get into Kennedy, this is just taking so
   long," and I had what I thought were some really good reasons not to
   stray far from the main path. Kathy Lingg, my co-executive producer,
   and J.J. both said, "Really? You really want to lose that part?
   Really?" They were so insistent in their questioning that it made me
   say, "Okay I have to reconsider this." I sort of sighed and went back
   and now I'm so happy that I did. It turned out to be one of our best
   episodes, it's episode three, so I thought initially about maybe taking
   away the Harry Dunning story.

   Now when looking back, what kind of glasses did you want to view that
   period through? It's not nostalgic — it's not gauzy and "Everything was
   simpler," but you do still have people saying "Food tastes better" and
   all of that. What was the balance of "The past might have been better
   in some ways" but also "Let's be honest, the past was kind of shit"?

   The past was kind of shit. I mean, to my taste, we probably still
   leaned too far on "Look at how beautiful this all is," because that's
   everybody's desire in all of television production. Nobody wants to
   make something ugly. Stephen King sent me an email early on and he
   said, "What I love about how you shaped this is that there were two
   things that I thought about the whole while writing this book — one was
   that the '60s were great and one was the '60s sucked." I thought that
   was really interesting that he said that to me. So visually what I
   wanted to go into was — like any other film nerd in the world, I love
   great composition, I love that stuff, but I was like, "What would it
   feel like if you were stepping into a '60s documentary?" Maybe we can
   be looking for a feeling that's a little more unstudied. It's not
   grainy — again because that is nostalgic. It's more like you can see
   textures and maybe we repeat clothes because people wear clothes more
   frequently. That there was a commonplace aspect to what visually we are
   trying to represent. I will say that in the first week of shooting, I
   would go around to all of our extras and then go to our makeup key and
   say, "You've got to wash these people's faces. They're very done. I
   need a little more undone." I went to the hair person and I said, "I
   know it's much easier and I completely understand if you want to put a
   wig on somebody, but first of all, I think they look like wigs and
   secondly, then that's really done hair and I just need people to look
   like human beings." I would say I really aspired for an unstudied
   artlessness or kind of a cinematic naturalism, hopefully, because I do
   love things to be pretty.

   How did that play into the re-creation of the assassination day?
   Reenactments of that day are so familiar; there are so many of them —
   from fictional works like Oliver Stone's JFK to documentary works.

   Well, my production designer Carol Spier and our costume designer
   Roland Sanchez are really obsessive researchers and perfectionists.
   You're absolutely right, it was so documented and Roland, I will say,
   pulled screen grabs of every frame of the [Abraham] Zapruder film and
   he meticulously recreated every costume from the film. He built those
   costumes for fifty extras, so there is a level of detail there that I
   loved, because it's easy to compare. There is no Jodie, Texas and there
   is no Holden, Ky. so we have a little license because we made those
   places up. But you're absolutely right: Dealey Plaza in Dallas exists
   and it's very easy to compare it because it was so massively
   photographed.

   Those were details which we were really willing to go to the mat for, I
   will say, too, that I really fought the good fight to shoot at Oswald's
   actual apartment house in Dallas. At a certain point we were really up
   against it for the budget and people said, "Well there's only a couple
   scenes" and I was like, "It doesn't matter. We have the opportunity to
   have our actors stand in the spot in the backyard where Oswald really
   stood and took that photograph of himself, and that felt really magical
   and eerie — a little haunted.

   Whose name opens doors to get to film in places like this? Is it
   J.J.'s? is it Stephen King's? What gets you in?

   It's both. I'm so lucky to have 1600 lbs of gorilla right on either
   side of me. Stephen King had spent an enormous amount of time at the
   Sixth Floor Museum in Dealey Plaza doing research, so everybody there
   knew him. That book is in the gift shop. Not only is he one of
   America's most famous authors, but he had just done his due diligence
   and everybody was thrilled that he had spent so much time there. That
   was a big deal. Then I will say too, the Dallas Film Commission, I
   think, was really thrilled to be helping out J.J. and Bad Robot.
   Everybody made it very easy, about as easy to film in another city as
   I've experienced. (Long pause.) Until we snarled the traffic and then
   they revoked our permits the next day. That became hard. That was
   tough.

   Now Hulu has been advertising this, of course, so much around the time
   travel and the stopping the JFK assassination and all of that, but
   anyone who's read the book knows that as the story arcs, this is a love
   story, this is a romance. How do you keep that part important when you
   know that people are coming for the other stuff?

   I'll tell you my first answer but I'm not sure it's the only answer. We
   cast Sarah Gadon and I think that she is just a massive talent, and I
   think that she and James Franco had really quite a lovely chemistry. It
   very naturally unfolded. What you are talking about — the fact that
   this is a love story and it wears the hat of an action movie, but
   really at it's core there's real romance — is exactly why I wanted to
   make it. But what a thing is, I think, is a little bit distinct from
   what you use to sell it. So it's kind of like, "Come for the JFK and
   stay for the romance," is how I look at it. I feel like the story
   speaks for itself.

   Having a star who's the busiest man in Hollywood has to bring with it
   some complications. Any fun stories about multi-tasking James Franco?

   Yes! (Laughs.) None of them are fun, it's all too soon. (Laughs.) No,
   there are no fun stories. No, you know what? James and I are great. I
   will say, there was at one point I got wind that he was going to fly
   somewhere to shoot a commercial and then someone let slip that it might
   be in Dubai and I was like, "Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?" I
   flipped and blew a gasket and he looked at me quietly and he was like,
   "I can tell you that I'm going to be back on Monday." And I'm like,
   "You had better be!" And then somebody called me like, "Oh no, no, no,
   it's not Dubai It's New York!" And I'm like, "Just forget it. Just
   don't tell me. Don't tell me."

   He would do things like he would leave, he would finish shooting at
   midnight on a Friday night, and he would get into the back of the car
   and he would sleep in the back of the car while one of his assistants
   drove him to New York so he could wake up from Toronto in New York.
   Then he would work on something with Cyndi Lauper there over the
   weekend, and then he would drive back and be ready for work. He was
   always ready for work.

   There was one time where he had done a horror short film and his hands
   were stained really red. That took like an extra half-hour in makeup to
   clean off the red blood from his other movie off his hands.
   (Laughs.) See I'm laughing now but really I want to start to cry.

   I will say, he is remarkable. He is tireless. He is not a complainer.
   He does not go away and hide in his trailer. He sits on set and he
   reads and he is ready to go. It's all great in the end. I will say too,
   I felt really lucky because he does so much, that he really blocked out
   what he did for six months. I mean everybody kept telling me he's never
   done anything for this long. Never. His agent called and she goes, "I
   love that he's doing this job, I always know where he is!" I was like,
   "That makes one of us! Just don't tell me where he is on Sunday." He
   was insane, but actually I'm saying that sort of glibly. He was not
   insane, he's actually completely on-point and prepared. I don't
   understand it but maybe there's a clone.

   How would you do personally in a similar situation to this story? How
   would you do if you were plunked down in an era and forced to make your
   way with a particular mission?

   I'm really haunted by a phrase that King uses in the book at a certain
   point: "casual racist." There'd be something that would really stick in
   my craw, I'd think, about the casualness and ease of racism and
   segregation at that time. It's something that we didn't confront enough
   of, and again, it comes down to trying to maintain the movement of the
   story.

   But, how would I do with a mission? I wouldn't do well with a mission.
   I would get sidetracked and go and want to see jazz in New York or
   something. I would want to go and see what Coney Island looked like at
   that time or something. I would go on a nostalgia trip I'm sure.

   11.22.63 premieres on Monday, Feb. 15 on Hulu.

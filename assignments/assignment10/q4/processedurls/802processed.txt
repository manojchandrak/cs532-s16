Early farmers minded their own beeswax

   Chemical traces of honeybee products discovered on Neolithic pottery
   from Europe to the Middle East.

   Neolithic farmers may have been well-acquainted with bees and beeswax.

   Early farmers had a sweet tooth. Pieces of Neolithic crockery from
   Europe, the Middle East and North Africa dating back 9,000 years bear
   chemical traces of beeswax, according to an analysis of thousands of
   potsherds that appears in Nature today^[35]1.

   Farming cultures of the time probably sweetened their food with honey,
   but bee products may have also found use in religious ceremonies and
   early medicines, researchers suspect.

   The relationship between humans and bees is much more ancient. A
   40,000-year-old lump of beeswax from Border Cave in South Africa may
   have been used to help bind stone points to wood to make spears^[37]2,
   for instance, and depictions of beehives are common in prehistoric rock
   art found all over sub-Saharan Africa.

   But the latest research is the strongest evidence yet that early
   farming cultures widely exploited products from honeybees (Apis
   mellifera).

   Agriculture emerged in the Middle East around 10,000 years ago, and
   waves of migrants carried the practice to Europe. A team led by Mélanie
   Roffet-Salque and Richard Evershed, chemists at the University of
   Bristol, UK, looked for beeswax residues in more than 6,400 clay
   cooking vessels across Eurasia dating from between 9,000 and 4,000
   years ago. Evershed’s team has previously discovered fat signatures of
   [38]meat, [39]dairy and [40]cheese in some of the same ancient
   crockery.

Rare but widespread

   Traces of beeswax fats were relatively uncommon — just 4 out of the 570
   vessels from northwestern Anatolia bore traces of bee products — but
   geographically widespread, the researchers found. Neolithic pottery
   from southern Britain and Denmark to the Balkans contained beeswax, as
   did artefacts from a 7,000-year-old site in Algeria. An iconic, nearly
   9,000-year-old site in Turkey called Çatalhöyük contained the oldest
   beeswax-bearing pot. A honeycomb pattern is painted onto a wall at this
   site, the authors note.

   Roffet-Salque says the widespread use of bee products among Neolithic
   groups could mark the beginnings of honeybee domestication. Neolithic
   farmers began co-opting cattle, pigs and other animals around this
   time, and may have seen honeybees in a similar light.

   But climate limited the spread of bees — whether wild or farmed — into
   Northern Europe. Pottery from Ireland, Scotland and northern
   Scandinavia contained no traces of beeswax, Roffet-Salque notes.

   “The paper is fantastic for what it shows about how bees are being used
   as a resource,” says Helen Anderson, a rock-art specialist at the
   British Museum in London. She has catalogued bee-related imagery in
   rock paintings from Africa, including Zimbabwe and Tanzania. She
   suspects that ancient Africans were honey hunters, not bee-keepers, but
   she wonders whether there are parallels between how humans used bees in
   Europe and the Middle East, and how they used the insects in Africa.
   “Perhaps while the archaeology isn’t there in Africa, we can start to
   make those comparisons,” she says.

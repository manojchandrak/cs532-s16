   The attorney for a man serving a life sentence for the 1984 murder of
   gas station attendant Bradley Newell Perry argued Wednesday at a Utah
   Supreme Court hearing that the [282]DNA evidence in the case has
   chain-of-custody problems.

   Attorney Jennifer Gowans Vandenberg said at least five hairs collected
   as evidence in Glenn Howard Griffin's case were not documented as
   coming from the crime scene.

   She also said a lawyer who represented Griffin at a critical phase in
   his trial conducted no investigation into a key prosecution witness.

   But Utah Assistant Attorney General John Nielsen countered that
   authorities kept track of the evidence, including hairs and dollar
   bills that had blood on them. And police reports show where the
   evidence was collected, he told the justices.

   In addition, Nielsen said Griffin had multiple experienced attorneys
   defending him before, during and after his trial.

   Griffin, now 58, is appealing his first-degree murder conviction and
   sentence of life without the possibility of parole. The Supreme Court
   took the arguments under consideration and will issue a ruling later.

   Perry was working the graveyard shift at a gas station near Brigham
   City on May 26, 1984, when he was tied up, bludgeoned with a soda
   canister and repeatedly stabbed with a screw driver, according to court
   documents. Two Utah State University students who stopped at the
   station in the early morning hours say a man came outside and offered
   to help pump the gas for them.

   One of the students gave the man five $1 bills and both saw what looked
   like dried blood on his clothes, according to court documents. When the
   second student started heading toward the station to get cigarettes,
   the man stopped him and said he would get them. The student gave a $5
   bill to the man, who returned with the pack and four dollars in change;
   those bills were among the ones that the first student had used to pay
   for the gas, court records say.

   The students noticed one of the bills had a drop of blood on it that
   looked fresh and sped down Highway 89 to a pay phone to call police.
   Court documents say the dollar bill was turned over to an officer.

   [283]Perry, a Weber State College student who was going to turn 23 in
   two days, was found dead. In addition to the dollar bill, police
   collected multiple hairs from inside the store, according to a brief by
   the attorney general's office.

   Police got search warrants for various suspects but could not
   immediately tie any of them to the slaying. The case went cold for more
   than two decades and the officers who collected the evidence have since
   died.

   But crime lab files showed the dollar bill and hairs had been kept in a
   vault and a cutting from the bill containing blood had been kept in a
   freezer since 1984, the attorney general's brief says.

   After DNA testing in 2005 allegedly tied Griffin to the slaying, Box
   Elder County prosecutors charged the Logan resident with capital
   murder, which carries a possible death sentence. A few months later a
   second suspect, Wade Garrett Maughan, also was charged in the killing.

   One of the witnesses at Griffin's 2008 trial in 1st District Court was
   Benjamin Britt, who testified he was an inmate in the Box Elder County
   jail while Griffin was housed there and overheard him confessing the
   slaying to another prisoner.

   The two attorneys defending Griffin had a law partner who had
   previously represented Britt so to avoid a conflict of interest, a
   third attorney was hired to cross-examine him.

   The attorney general's brief says the third attorney had represented
   another jail inmate two and a half years before the trial who had been
   Maughan's cellmate and who claimed he heard Maughan say that he,
   Griffin and another man had committed the murder. The attorney and the
   cellmate offered the testimony in exchange for the cellmate's freedom
   but the prosecutor declined, the brief says.

   At Wednesday's hearing, Gowans Vandenberg said the attorney had a
   conflict of interest because of his efforts on behalf of Maughan's
   cellmate. Nielsen, though, said there was no conflict because the
   cellmate never testified and got no benefit from his offer to testify.

   After 12 hours of deliberation, a jury on Nov. 14, 2008 [284]found
   Griffin guilty, and he was later sentenced to life.

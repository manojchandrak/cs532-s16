Female same-sex parents win right for both to be on child's birth certificate
as SA Parliament backs rule change

   By [99]Tom Fedorowytsch

   A rule that prevented both females in a same-sex relationship from
   being recognised on their children's birth certificates will be changed
   in South Australia after passage of a bill through both houses of State
   Parliament.

Key points:

     * Same-sex parents were required to prove they had lived together for
       three years for both to be listed on birth certificates
     * MLC Tammy Franks says bill changing that rule was slow to get
       through SA's Parliament
     * Bill passed Lower House in conscience vote 29-12

   Elise Duffield gave birth to a son Tadhg on Mother's Day in 2014, but a
   rule prevented her partner Sally Amazon from also being on the birth
   certificate.

   The rule required the couple to prove they had lived together for three
   years, a time frame which would not be applied to heterosexual couples
   who were able to legally marry.

   "I read the fine print, it said we had to have lived together for three
   years before conception, which we hadn't," Ms Duffield said.

   Ms Amazon agreed the couple could have lied, but said they chose not
   to.

   Ms Amazon said she had been worried her lack of legal status as Tadhg's
   parent would later become an issue and was pleased the legislative
   change had made its way through the Parliament.

   "It means a tremendous relief â€” we've been in legal limbo since Tadhg
   was born," she said.

   "We planned together to have this baby and had no expectation we were
   going to have any problems registering as co-parents.

   "We've just been crossing our fingers that we haven't had any traumas
   in our lives that meant that legal limbo caused us any problems."

   Ms Amazon said it was good news for her entire family, not just young
   Tadhg.

   "It also means that his siblings who live with him will be his legal
   siblings," she said.

   "He has a whole side of the family that was invisible."

   Ms Duffield shared the relief that their campaign for equality for
   Tadhg was all but over now.

   "It's been a long time coming, he's 22 months old [this week]," she
   said.

Small issue of greater importance, MLC says

   Greens MLC Tammy Franks steered the bill through the state Upper House
   last June, and sat with Tadhg and his parents as it passed the Lower
   House on Wednesday.

   "Most people in the community couldn't understand what the fuss was
   about or why it was taking so long," Ms Franks said.

   "It's been incredibly offensive to see this very small issue, that's so
   important to a very small number of people, stretch out over almost a
   year of debate."

   long to get through both Houses. (ABC News)

   The bill passed the Lower House in a conscience vote 29-12.

   Liberal MP Adrian Pederick said feedback from people in his electorate
   had been entirely negative.

   "I think it also brings about some problems in regards to a child
   having an ability to track their genealogy later in life," he said.

   Attorney-General John Rau was supportive of the bill's intent but
   expressed concern about its timing, ahead of a broader review of
   discriminating laws in South Australia.

   "We should wait until they've finished and done a comprehensive review
   before we start doing piecemeal moves," he said.

   But the bill passed with support across party lines, including from
   Liberal MP David Pisoni and Labor MP Katrine Hildyard.

   Ms Franks said she remained keen to see more rights achieved for
   same-sex couples.

   "The public supports same-sex marriage, the politicians are still a bit
   scared but they should realise there's nothing to be afraid of," she
   said.

   Once the legislation is rubber-stamped by the Upper House, Tadhg's
   parents will be able to apply for his birth certificate to be
   re-issued.

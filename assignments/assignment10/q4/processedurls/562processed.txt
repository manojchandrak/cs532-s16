Yolanda Foster & Lisa Rinna: TWITTER FEUD ALERT!

   Yolanda Foster and her children’s Lyme disease continues to be a hot
   topic on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, and now it’s become a
   hot topic on Twitter.

   The former model and RHOBH cast mate Lisa Rinna exchanged jabs on the
   social media platform over who-said-what about Yolanda and her kids’
   condition.

   Let’s back up a sec.

   In episodes past, we’ve seen the Housewives [12]question whether
   Yolanda really has Lyme or is faking it.

   Then in October, after she announced her children Bella and Anwar
   Hadid were also suffering from the condition, Lisa Vanderpump
   insinuated that [13]she heard from the kids’ father Mohamed that the
   kids were “fine” and did not have Lyme.

   Well, this pissed off Yolanda big time.

   She had reason to believe Lisa Rinna also said the kids were Lyme-free,
   which set off a entire she said-she said debacle that eventually led to
   Housewife Erika Girardi admitting in a confessional that she was the
   guilty party.

   However, when Yolanda responded to a fan’s question about why she
   fingered Rinna, she answered:

   This made Rinna most unhappy, claiming she’d been a scapegoat then
   turning the tables on Yolanda.

   Yolanda fired back:

   (Munchausen syndrome is a psychological disorder in which a person
   feigns an illness to receive sympathy or attention.)

   The two remained silent for a few hours, possibly because they both
   went and took naps.

   This exchange is somewhat puzzling, because [14]Rinna was actually on
   Yolanda’s side last year when the other Housewives accused her of
   faking her disease.

   But, hey, a Twitter war makes for good headlines, and possibly more
   viewers to the high-drama Bravo show.

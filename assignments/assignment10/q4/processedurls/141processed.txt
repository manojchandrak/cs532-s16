   Jordin Sparks, Sage the Gemini

   Looks like it just wasn't in the stars for [32]Jordin Sparks and Sage
   the Gemini.

   The "Double Tap" singer and the "Gas Pedal" rapper have broken up after
   about nine months of dating, sources confirm to E! News.

   According to one insider, their relationship started off great in the
   beginning but as time went on Sparks was having trust issues—and Sage
   wasn't helping the matter any with his behavior. They had previously
   been able to work things out, but not this time. Having gone through a
   [33]rough breakup with long-term boyfriend [34]Jason Derulo, Sparks
   just didn't want to go there again with Sage, the source says.

   Sparks and Sage, whose real name is Dominic Woods, were first linked
   romantically back in April 2015 and a source confirmed that they were
   seeing each other but "[36]taking things slow."

   Last July, Sparks [37]opened up more about the relationship to E! News,
   calling Sage "just an amazing guy."

   She continued, "He's very sweet. He's got a big heart. He cherishes me,
   he just makes me feel so loved, and I feel like that's how anybody
   would want to feel in a relationship."

   But the 26-year-old star, who was with Derulo for [38]three years prior
   to dating Sage, also admitted that she's still figuring things out when
   it comes to life and love because...well, she's human, isn't she?

   "I feel like the 20s, you're learning who you are, you're figuring out
   really what you love, and what you like," she explained to us last
   summer.

   Indeed. And rest assured, there's plenty of time ahead to figure it all
   out. And it's looks like she just had a pretty amazing weekend, Sparks
   sharing pics from her perch at Levi's Stadium during Super Bowl 50.

   "'BELIEVE IN LOVE' Such a great message. What a fantastic Super Bowl
   halftime show!!! #sb50 #jse2016 #imay," she [39]captioned one of her
   photos.

   [40]Us Weekly was first with the split news.

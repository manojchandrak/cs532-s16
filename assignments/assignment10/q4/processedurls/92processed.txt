RevZilla, Cycle Gear and the road ahead

   Revzilla1210

   Dear ZLA Army,

   Over the last week, the buzz surrounding RevZilla‚Äôs future plans has
   been at the redline and the hardest part has been staying quiet in the
   face of the mixture of fact, fiction and sensationalism. We've been
   itching to share our next plan of attack, but we weren't able to do so
   until an agreement was signed (the deal is still subject to regulatory
   approval). We‚Äôre happy to finally be able to share details and give you
   a [31]ZLA level of transparency via this letter and the linked [32]FAQ.

   Today, we are excited to announce that Matt, Nick and I will be
   partnering with J.W. Childs to form a new holding company that will own
   both Cycle Gear and RevZilla. Both sister companies will operate
   separately, but the ultimate intent is further elevating how all
   motorcyclists are served, online and off. It is an opportunity we have
   watched and evaluated since Cycle Gear was acquired by J.W. Childs in
   early 2015.

   So, why now?

   A little over eight years ago, Matt, Nick and I founded RevZilla out of
   our apartment and [33]tiny store in Philadelphia. We set out to build
   the destination that we thought was missing from the motorcycle
   industry: natively digital and customer experience focused, with
   passion taking top billing from the expected norms of selection and low
   prices.

   You could say we have been aggressive in attacking the opportunity and
   RevZilla‚Äôs success has certainly reflected that. We also have always
   tried to find the balance between full throttle growth and being
   responsible for the livelihoods of the now nearly 200 people on staff.
   It‚Äôs been sweepers and whoops for sure, especially being bootstrapped
   and self-funding it all. It‚Äôs also very surreal to think that we took
   our first order from our bombed-out Philly apartment where [34]Nick‚Äôs
   room had a sheet for a door.

   RevZilla could easily follow the double yellows and be successful doing
   what we‚Äôve always done, but we like new challenges, placing big bets
   and playing to win. We also like to think that we understand the next
   generation of commerce and have the vision to shape what we believe the
   future should be. It‚Äôs in our DNA as entrepreneurs.

   Today, the larger and more exciting opportunity is to think about how
   RevZilla can leverage new capital to scale more quickly and entertain
   new opportunities like our own retail destination stores or
   international expansion. We‚Äôll still operate with the same orange
   culture and ethos that has earned the trust of riders for the better
   part of a decade. We don‚Äôt know how to do it any differently and I‚Äôm
   not about to sit back as the leader who remembers what ‚Äúthe [35]orange
   used to mean.‚Äù

   Apart from the benefits to RevZilla, we also believe that our new
   parent company could leverage our superpowers to accelerate and elevate
   Cycle Gear. The current Cycle Gear team is talented and focusing their
   attack on the right things while navigating a lot of change. We‚Äôre
   excited to support the effort moving forward.

   So what does all this mean?

   RevZilla and Cycle Gear will continue to operate independently, as
   sister companies owned by myself, Matt, Nick and J.W. Childs. Regarding
   the internet's concerns about carelessly [36]smashing the companies
   together tomorrow ‚Äî Stop. Exhale. We‚Äôre two brands and two companies.
   The dumbest thing we could do would be to screw up the things we‚Äôre
   already great at; the things that so many of you [37]love. The era of
   big companies faking it at the consumers‚Äô expense because of limited
   choices is long gone. We believe the internet and the [38]abundance
   economy of limitless choice rewards [39]brand meritocracy. Staying in
   the lead means continuing to earn it with you, just as we always have.

   We‚Äôre juiced to shift into the next chapter. We trust our instincts and
   are still having a blast. We‚Äôre still betting on ourselves, TeamZilla,
   and now J.W. Childs, that we can continue to change the game.  For over
   eight years, we‚Äôve been contrarian about what would work in
   motorcycling, but you have continued to help carry our message. Because
   of you we‚Äôre relevant, have a huge audience and continue to have the
   [40]huge orange balls to pull off huge new things.

   It has been downright amazing over the last few days to see the level
   of protectiveness you showed for RevZilla in social media and the
   forums. You get it. You appreciate it. We‚Äôre still waiting for you at
   the bar, no gold chains in sight. I pinch myself that we created a
   brand you are so [41]connected with. If we can‚Äôt continue to make
   RevZilla better while keeping our promises, you should shop somewhere
   else. RevZilla exists because we wouldn‚Äôt stand for any less, and
   [42]neither should you.

   RevZilla‚Äôs mission will remain to advance the experience of the
   motorcycle enthusiast through community, content and commerce. Our job
   is still to find your pain and alleviate it. Matt, Nick and I are still
   firmly at the helm and we‚Äôre certainly not looking to alter a secret
   recipe that so many of you love, just expand our [43]orange dent in the
   moto-universe.

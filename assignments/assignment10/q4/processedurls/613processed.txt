     PANAMA CITY — Mechelle Grady, a paraprofessional at Springfield
     Elementary School, was named Bay District School’s Support Employee
     of the Year at a ceremony Tuesday night at Florida State University
     Panama City’s Holley Academic Center.

     “This is an honor just to represent you,” Grady said, fighting back
     tears. “This is one of the greatest honors I have ever received.”

     Known for her positive attitude and helpful heart, Grady organizes
     student activities such as Tiger Idol, Fantasy Ball and other
     after-school events. She also plans an annual field trip to a large
     city for fifth-graders and raised money to make sure even low-income
     students can attend with their classmates. She also mentors at-risk
     youth across Bay County through a community gospel choir.

     Grady, who has worked for the district for more 30 years, said one
     of the things she enjoys is knowing students are the district’s
     greatest commodity and the time used to work with them is the time
     she loves.

     The award, sponsored by the Panhandle Educators Federal Credit
     Union, honors district employees who keep the schools running every
     day, from bus drivers to food service workers, maintenance workers
     and secretaries.

     “You do so many of the tasks and jobs we take for granted, but we
     appreciate it,” Superintendent Bill Husfelt said.

     This year, Husfelt said he approached the School Board about naming
     the award after Ann Smith, a longtime support employee who had
     helped thousands of teachers begin their careers before she retired
     last year. Britt Smith, principal at Jinks Middle School and Smith’s
     son, said his mother was honored to have the award named after her,
     and spoke of the importance of support employees.

     “The first person students see in the day is a support employee,” he
     said. “And probably the last. You begin and end the day. There’s no
     way we could do the work we do without you.”

     Forty-two support employees were nominated for the award this year
     before the field was whittled down to five finalists.

     Other finalists were Bay High Athletic Secretary Cindy Harris, who
     maintains the school’s various data systems while overseeing student
     athletes; and Terry Robbins, confidential secretary from Cedar Grove
     who volunteers for the Blessings in a Backpack program and raised
     enough money for the 500 students to receive a kickball for
     Christmas.

     The other two finalists were Nan St. Germain, confidential secretary
     at Patronis Elementary, who mentors new teachers and has forged a
     strong relationship between the district and the Navy Base; and
     Terry Greek, bookkeeper in the Nelson Administrative Building, who
     was nominated for managing the bookkeeping for 26 departmental
     budgets totaling $17.6 million.

     Grady will represent the district in the state’s Support Employee of
     the Year program.

     “This is a great opportunity and I will try my best to represent you
     well,” Grady said.

     The finalists were vetted by six person selection committee.

     This was the second employee of the year award taken home by
     Springfield Elementary. Last month, art teacher Kesia Milner was
     named the district’s Teacher of the Year.

   The Department of Justice sued Ferguson, [50]Missouri, on Wednesday to
   force an overhaul of the beleaguered city’s criminal justice system.

   report finds

   US attorney general Loretta Lynch moved swiftly to file a civil rights
   lawsuit following a decision by Ferguson’s city council on Tuesday to
   [52]challenge several measures in a draft reform agreement that the
   city had negotiated with federal officials.

   “We intend to aggressively prosecute this case, and we intend to
   prevail,” Lynch said at a press conference in Washington on Wednesday.

   The lawsuit, which was filed to federal court even before Lynch began
   speaking, alleges that [53]Ferguson is guilty of a “pattern or
   practice” of law enforcement actions violating the first, fourth and
   14th amendments of the US constitution and federal civil rights laws.

   “The residents of Ferguson have suffered the deprivation of their
   constitutional rights – the rights guaranteed to all Americans – for
   decades,” said Lynch. “They have waited decades for justice. They
   should not be forced to wait any longer.”

   Jeff Small, a spokesman for Ferguson, said in an email that officials
   there had only learned of the action through media reports and that
   they were not ready to comment.

   The agreement, which was reached over a painstaking months-long
   process, was aimed at remedying racist practices in the courts and
   policing of the St Louis suburb, which erupted into unrest twice in
   2014 over the fatal shooting by a white police officer of Michael
   Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old.

   A pattern of serious problems was detailed in a scathing report
   published last year after an [54]inquiry by Justice Department
   investigators. It concluded that residents routinely had their
   constitutional rights violated through unjustified arrests, traffic
   stops and other actions. “These violations were not only egregious,
   they were routine,” Lynch said on Wednesday.

   On Tuesday, the city of Ferguson outlined seven objections to the
   Justice Department’s proposed agreement, which would have forced it to
   pay for a federal monitor to oversee the running of city’s criminal
   justice system and spend money on salary raises for police officers and
   other city employees. It also required the city to agree to basic
   principles of constitutional policing.

   James Knowles III, the city’s part-time mayor, has repeatedly warned
   that the costs of implementing the reform agreement – known as a
   “consent decree”, could be financially ruinous. The city of 22,000
   people has seen its budget suffer after it agreed to reduce the
   [55]amount of revenue it collected in fines and fees for minor offences
   from poverty-stricken residents.

   The city’s new proposals include a requirement that the terms of the
   agreement not extend to other agencies in Ferguson who take over
   current city operations. Such a change would nullify much of the
   agreement should the city disband its police force. The original
   agreement was applicable to any policing agency in Ferguson.

   In addition, city councillors insisted that the agreement remove a
   mandate for additional salary for city employees. Ferguson’s city
   council voted unanimously for this conditional approval, and said the
   Department of Justice must agree to all seven conditions for the
   agreement to take effect.
   [56]Ferguson lawsuit The Department of Justice has opened a civil
   rights lawsuit against the city of Ferguson.

   City officials released the proposed agreement in January, and have
   held three public meetings since then to discuss its provisions. In a
   statement on Tuesday evening, city officials cited concerns about the
   cost and “comprehensive and far-reaching scale” of the agreement as
   reasons for the amendments.

   A provision in the federal criminal justice reforms of 1994 gives the
   justice department wide-ranging authority to investigate regional law
   enforcement agencies. In situations where federal officials find a
   pattern or practice of constitutional violations, as in Ferguson, city
   officials can sign a reform agreement or risk a lawsuit. Should the
   DoJ’s suit prevail, federal officials can force reforms in Ferguson.

   [60]One year after Ferguson, change moves slowly

   A lawsuit filed by the justice department against Colorado City and
   neighboring Hildale, Utah, over alleged discriminatory policing
   practices is [61]currently in trial.

   The Alamance County sheriff’s department in North Carolina is the only
   agency to have beaten the DoJ in a pattern or practice case since 1994.
   A federal judge sided with the local agency in August 2015 and ruled
   that the justice department had failed to prove its allegations of
   discriminatory policing. The DoJ is appealing the judge’s verdict.

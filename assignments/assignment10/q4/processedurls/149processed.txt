   A former teacher and current ASIC senior executive has been charged
   with abusing a 14-year-old boy in the 1980s.

   Peter Cuzner, 60 of Kaleen, pleaded not guilty on Thursday to three
   acts of indecency against the boy in 1986.

   Cuzner was a teacher at a number of schools in the ACT, including
   Daramalan College, although it is not yet clear where the alleged abuse
   occurred.

   He is currently listed as the ASIC regional commissioner for the ACT, a
   senior executive position, but was suspended once the organisation
   learned of the allegations.

   Cuzner was charged after a lengthy police operation prompted by the
   Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse.

   ACT Policing set up Operation Attest, a team of highly experienced
   child abuse investigators, last year, and revealed on Monday they were
   bringing four people to court this week.

   [61]Three of those cases appeared in the ACT Magistrates Court on
   Tuesday, including two against Marist brothers, Brother John William
   Chute, also known as Brother Kostka, and former Brother Gregory
   Sutton.

   Those two Marist brothers were the focus of Canberra hearings of the
   child sexual abuse Royal Commission.

   Cuzner attended court on Thursday, but said nothing as he left the
   courtroom.

   His case has been adjourned for 10 weeks, and will come back before the
   ACT Magistrates Court in late April.

   ASIC spokesman Matthew Abbott said the organisation was currently
   reviewing who would act as its new ACT regional commissioner.

   "This is a police matter and we're unable to comment at this stage," Mr
   Abbott said.

   "Peter was stood down as of the 28th of January."

   "We're reviewing who will become the next ACT regional commissioner."

   On Tuesday, the ACT Magistrates Court heard that Marist
   Brother Kostka was suffering dementia, and was currently seeking a
   ruling in separate NSW proceedings that he was not fit to stand trial.

   Brother Kostka's lawyer indicated a similar approach would be taken in
   the ACT.

   Brother Sutton may try to have proceedings against him permanently
   stayed. He is in Australia only due to an extradition that occurred in
   a past case, and there may be an argument that he cannot be charged
   with new offences while in the country on a separate extradition.

   The third man who was due to appear on Tuesday did not attend court.
   There is no formal proof that he was served with a summons.

   An earlier version of this story suggested Peter Cuzner worked at
   Marist College Canberra. This was incorrect. A reporter made the
   error.

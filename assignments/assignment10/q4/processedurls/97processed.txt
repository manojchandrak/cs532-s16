   Including overtime and the unofficial shots of the shootout, the New
   York Islanders peppered rookie Columbus Blue Jackets goalie Joonas
   Korpisalo with 50 shots on net yet only barely escaped with both points
   -- er, two of the three points asexually made available by virtue of an
   NHL game exceeding 60 minutes -- on a night where they dominated the
   second half.

   Their 3-2 shootout road win was earned the hard way after trailing 2-1
   as the third period began, though that's small comfort against the
   Metro's basement dweller. After gaining the lead 56 seconds into the
   game, the Isles listed for much of the first period before steadily
   turning things around in the final two-thirds and requiring heroic work
   from Korpisalo to force overtime.

   Korpisalo has been great for the Blue Jackets the last couple of weeks
   filling in for the injured Sergei Bobrovsky and Curtis McElhinney, so
   the elements of a torturous script were there -- including the factoid
   that Korpisalo recently gave up five goals to the Oilers squad the
   Isles just thumped. But after the Blue Jackets took the lead tonight,
   every interruption in pressure was backstopped by good work from
   Jaroslav Halak, who made 29 saves and was particularly good on several
   odd-man opportunities in overtime.

First Period: Hey This Is Going To Be Easy...Not

   The Islanders scored in the first minute, on a set play faceoff-and-rip
   reminiscent of Ryan Strome's junior heyday, and maybe that gave them
   the wrong sense of complacency, like goals would continue to roll in
   like they did Sunday on the #HereComeTheOilers.

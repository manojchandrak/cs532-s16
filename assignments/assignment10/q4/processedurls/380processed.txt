          + [26]It’s time to look inward at how you are fostering
            innovation[27] Wieden + Kennedy London office walk in stupid
            mannequin In this guest post, Dr Amantha Imber discusses why
            disruption should be performed inside a company to ensure best
            practise and a positive culture before turning to the outside
            market. Agencies’ primary purpose is to come up with creative
            solutions to their clients’ (marketing) problems. Creative
            energy is directed externally and often with good results. As
            an outsider to the industry but through my role heading up the
            team that judges the Australian Financial Review’s Most
            Innovative Companies list, the elephant in the room is the
            lack of effort toward innovation directed internally into how
            agencies run and how they make money.
          + [28]Not quite time to stop the press[29] Inside Retail Weekly
            2016 In this guest post, Nati Harpaz argues that print is far
            from dead and remains a viable profit and engagement platform
            as long as you are prepared to adapt your model. The struggle
            faced by traditional print publications such as newspapers is
            well documented as the industry faces increasing competition
            from the online world. In fact, just recently, this discussion
            was reignited after Fairfax’s chief executive, Greg Hywood,
            commented to investors that the company was willing to cut
            print editions of major mastheads, if publishing profit
            continued to spiral.

          + [32]The master marketer returns: can Mark Buckman's magic
            strike thrice?[33] Mumbrella Awards 2013 Mark Buckman Foxtel
            rolled the marketing dice this week in announcing the return
            of Mark Buckman to lead its customer experience. Simon
            Canning discusses why Foxtel chose the man who has reshaped
            two of Australia's biggest brands. The [34]return of Mark
            Buckman to Australian shores two years after he headed to the
            UK to try his hand will be one of the most closely monitored
            marketing moves in recent times.

            client[36] antony_gowthorp-5340 With sales and marketing
            anointing ever-younger staff as account executives, the need
            for confident, empathetic and conversationally astute
            communication - and staff training - is more vital than ever,
            says Ant Gowthorp, in this guest column. Account directors and
            waiters never used to have so much in common. One was an
            experienced, hard-working media professional, highly practiced
            at her craft and realistic about her client’s goals and
            expectations. The other was an order taker, charged with
            wrangling the kitchen and making the customer experience as
            pleasant and obliging as possible.

            track Today marks six months since Woolworths made one of the
            poorest decisions in Australian loyalty marketing history by
            ditching its Everyday Rewards scheme. The disastrous move to
            near-impossible-to-acquire Woolworths Dollars has removed many
            of the incentives for customers to spend more - and left them
            with virtually no reason to share their data with the
            supermarket, argues Mumbrella's Tim Burrowes.     I've been on
            strike for a while now. Virtually every night I stick it to
            the man.

            maelstroms and the future of the ABC[40] Mark Scott ABC ABC
            managing director Mark Scott steps down this week after a
            decade which has left the public broadcaster transformed. He
            spoke to Nic Christensen about leading that change, dealing
            with critics 'hijacking' the conversation and the lessons
            commercial media can learn from Aunty.   "I do regret the
            public discourse on the ABC," says outgoing managing director,
            Mark Scott, as we begin the interview. After 10 years in the
            role Scott is in a reflective mood and appears eager to admit
            that he is also slightly perplexed at why, at times, under his
            stewardship the ABC has been so hammered by sections of the
            press.

            at 9.34.24 am Gen Y loves their memes and both millennials and
            marketers are using them more and more to connect to younger
            audiences but we are propelling a false and negative
            stereotype? Tym Yee asks do we need a war on meme? We can’t
            afford houses. We’re over educated. We spend money. The job
            market is an asshole. Yes, we millennials face a depressing
            lot in life.

            Conversation, Marc C-Scott looks at the growing battle for
            eyeballs as TV audiences continue to decline.  It’s not been a
            good year so far for Australia’s traditional television
            industry with reports that [45]prime-time audiences are down
            almost 5% amid competition from internet streaming services.

            Mumbrella Asia editor Robin Hicks talks about the past
            few years and what he sees as a time of
            unprecedented disruption for marketing and media in Asia.
            We are three. Some people, including many of our friends, have
            since told us they didn’t think we’d make it this far. But
            here we are, 7,101 articles, three million page views and five
            live events later. And I think the industry is now beginning
            to realise we’re in it for the long haul.
          + [48]60 Minutes kidnapping fiasco comes down to the question:
            who signed off on the money for the 'child recovery
            operation'?[49] Newspapers The fate of the 60 Minutes crew,
            who were stuck in a Beirut jail facing kidnapping charges, has
            dominated headlines for weeks. Nic Christensen looks at the
            questions Nine's management team now faces and the questions
            whether anyone will be held to account. The plight of
            journalist Tara Brown, Brisbane mother Sally Faulkner and the
            60 Minutes crew has, rightly, kicked off a public debate about
            the ethics of chequebook journalism. But the key questions
            here are: what did Nine think it was paying for? How did they
            think it was okay to make a $115,000 payment to ex-soldiers to
            grab children from their grandparents in the middle of Beirut?
            And finally who signed off on all this?

            believes KFC's sexually suggestive Hot & Spicy 'Coming Soon'
            ad served to prove the brand has now worked out exactly
            who its audience is and what they want from the brand. I was
            watching TV last night and up came the advertisement for KFC
            'hot and spicy' chicken. A family-friendly themed
            advertisement with the usual characters you might find in a
            fast food television commercial. The family, the young people,
            the working man and the like, all enjoying a hearty meal of
            chicken.

            The second survey of the year has delivered fluid results in
            key markets such as Adelaide and Melbourne. For HitFM a strong
            result for Hamish and Andy in Drive was overshadowed by the
            ongoing failure of Rove and Sam to gain any movement in
            breakfast. Nic Christensen speaks with the radio bosses about
            survey two.  If there was one thing many in the radio industry
            were looking at in this survey it was for some movement in
            2DayFM's much-promoted new breakfast show featuring Rove
            McManus and Sam Frost. Sadly, for the HitFM Network it wasn't
            to be.

            to public anger over its failure to support same sex marriage
            Telstra thought supporting marriage equality was something
            that involved adding a logo to an ad - a statement that could
            be easily walked away from. It's not. And in doing so Simon
            Canning believes the brand has breached an important public
            trust. The double reverse ferret by Telstra this week on its
            support for marriage equality looks more like a business that
            suddenly did the math than one that had a Road to Damascus
            moment and realised it had simply failed to understand the
            importance of a social movement.

            ‘half of Australia’s independent PR agencies will go under in
            the next five years’ has caused quite a stir.

Quickflix looks to restructure Stan’s shares in business claiming it is
putting off investors

   [59]Quickflix Australia’s first streaming service Quickflix is trying
   to get rival Stan to restructure a massive share block it holds in the
   business, claiming it is putting off new investors as it seeks a new
   round of capital raising.

   In 2014 Stan, owned by Nine Entertainment and Fairfax Media, [60]bought
   a $1m shareholding from US cable giant HBO which also came with a
   series of warrants and covenants effectively blocking Quickflix from
   being sold without the new owners paying more than $10.5m to Stan.

   Quickflix today put out a statement to the Australian Securities
   Exchange saying it was now looking to “restructure” Stan’s shares as it
   goes into yet another round of capital-raising from investors claiming
   they are “a significant disincentive for incoming investors”.

RELATED: [61]Why Nine’s investment in Quickflix makes it tougher for Netflix
to launch in Australia

   At the end of last month [62]Quickflix filed its latest accounts (ASX:
   QFX) which showed the company has just $659,000 cash on hand and had
   seen a 22% fall in subscriber numbers for the quarter.

   On Christmas Eve it [63]also snuck out an announcement that it had
   restructured $7.5m owed to major studios for licensing agreements,
   while last month CEO Stephen Langsford told Mumbrella the business was
   pivoting away from streaming to concentrate on its still profitable DVD
   delivery and on-demand movie businesses.

   In today’s statement, Quickflix said: “In order to progress its
   restructure and raise new capital, Quickflix is therefore seeking to
   reach agreement with Stan for the immediate restructuring of the RPS.”

   Quickflick’s market cap on the ASX is $2.22m.

   According to the statement, Stan’s holding must also legally be
   recorded as a debt of $11.6m on the Quickflix books.

   It adds: “Whilst Stan can only ask for redemption of the RPS
   (redeemable preference shares) in limited circumstances, the company
   will rank behind the RPS.”

   Stan has been approached for comment.

       It feels like there is an element of schadenfreude to Mumbrella’s
       reporting on Quickflix. Many other Australian businesses are
       struggling, but not so well reported.

       kudos to the entrepreneurs not wanting to walk away, but at some
       point, you’ve got to admit failure. lick your wounds, and move on.
       no shame in it.

       Hi K,
       We take no pleasure in reporting on any struggling business, but
       these are important stories that need to be told accurately and
       fully.
       Quickflix also has continuous disclosure obligations under its ASX
       listing, which puts a lot more info out about it than most
       struggling companies.
       Cheers,
       Alex – editor, Mumbrella

       How is Quickflix still even a thing currently? If it was a dog it
       would have been put down a long time ago.

       Stans position has absolutely no relevance for attracting
       investment. Of greater importance is the festering carcass of a
       business that was quickflix, an entity that only a retarded monkey
       with an innate ability to lose millions would consider tipping more
       cash into.

       I completely agree K. I’ve been following the streaming wars as an
       unbiased non investor and reading almost all the articles that go
       with it. I don’t think I could predict the outcome of quickflix
       with the absolute certainty that others seem to have. Quickflix
       survives and many will eat their words.

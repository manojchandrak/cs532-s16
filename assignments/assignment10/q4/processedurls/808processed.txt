   Tesla Model S

   Tesla is set to unveil the production Model 3 electric vehicle on March
   31, according to its quarterly earnings release. The budget electric
   vehicle (EV) promises a price tag of $35,000 (£30,000 in the UK) and
   200 miles of pure electric driving.

   The price tag is before any federal or state tax incentives, which can
   bring the cost as low as $25,000, if you live in the right state.
   Tesla's aggressive pricing puts the Model 3 slightly lower than the
   upcoming Bolt, which Chevy prices at $37,500 MSRP.

   But, you'll have to wait a while to purchase a Model 3. Production and
   delivery of the budget EV doesn't start until late 2017. Chevy plans to
   roll out the 200-mile range [39]Chevy Bolt later this year as a 2017
   model year car, getting a one-year head start on Tesla.

   Tesla's timeline for the Model 3 puts it as a 2018 model year vehicle,
   and it will face fierce competition. Nissan recently updated the
   [40]Nissan Leaf EV for 2016, but a completely new model is right around
   the corner that promises even more range. Meanwhile, Ford is planning
   an all-new Focus for 2018, with an accompanying electric model to
   follow.

   As an owner of a 2015 Nissan Leaf SL, longer range EVs are appealing to
   me. However, gas prices keep going down in the US, which makes a harder
   case for switching over to EVs.

   I managed to fill the gas tank of a Ford Mustang GT review car for $25
   (about £17, AU$35), which makes me less likely to take the Leaf, just
   so I don't have to deal with public charging. That's going to make for
   an interesting challenge for not only Tesla, but all EV makers.

Six female scientists who changed history: Beatrix Potter, Hedy Lamarr and
the woman who saved America from thalidomide

   By Tegan Taylor

   An author, an actress and more than one whose work was ripped off by
   men. On the [101]first United Nations International Day of Women and
   Girls in Science, take a look at six female scientists who helped shape
   history.

Hedy Lamarr (Hedwig Keisler)

   1914 - 2000

   Lamarr was an inventor who developed a radio guidance system for
   torpedoes and frequency-hopping technology now used in wi-fi and
   Bluetooth technology. (Supplied: Wikimedia)

   Austrian and American film actress Hedwig Keisler, or Hedy Lamarr, was
   known in her heyday as "the most beautiful woman in the world", but she
   was also the inventor of the precursor to the type of wireless
   communications used today in mobile phones, GPS and wi-fi.

   Working with composer George Antheil, Lamarr developed a radio guidance
   system for torpedoes that used "frequency hopping" to stop
   transmissions being jammed or intercepted.

   The pair patented a frequency-hopping device that worked like the roll
   from a self-playing piano, and donated their invention to the US Navy.

   The Navy did not end up using the invention during the war, but the
   idea was revived in the 1950s and became the inspiration for
   spread-spectrum technology that is the basis of modern-day wireless
   communications.

Beatrix Potter

   1866 - 1943

   Best known for her work as a children's author, Beatrix Potter was also
   an accomplished botanist, with a particular interest in mycology, or
   the study of fungi.

   She was the first person in Britain to speculate in a scientific paper
   that lichens were symbiotic life forms and developed the theory that
   fungi reproduced using spores, a claim that was rejected at the time.

   Potter conducted experiments in her kitchen and recorded in detail her
   observations of algal and fungal properties.

Dorothy Hodgkin

   X-ray techniques of the structures of important biochemical
   substances". (Supplied: Nobel Media)

   1910 - 1994

   Dorothy Hodgkin was one of just two girls at her school who were
   allowed to join the boys in chemistry class.

   She then went on to Oxford University to research the relatively new
   technique X-ray crystallography.

   The technique involves crystallising a substance, shooting X-rays at it
   and then doing complex computations on how the X-rays are diffracted to
   work out the three-dimensional shape of molecules.

   Hodgkin's most significant work was determining the structures of
   penicillin, insulin and vitamin B12, winning her the Nobel Prize in
   chemistry in 1964.

Rosalind Franklin

   1920 - 1958

   crystollographer who made huge advances toward discovering the
   double-helix shape of DNA. (Supplied: Wikimedia)

   Rosalind Franklin helped us understand some of the most basic building
   blocks of our bodies, using X-ray diffraction to discover the shape of
   DNA.

   She set up a laboratory where she took increasingly clear photos of DNA
   diffraction and spent a year doing mathematical analysis, inching
   towards the conclusion that it had a double-helix structure.

   Without her permission, Franklin's fellow researcher Maurice Wilkins
   showed one of her photos to James Watson and Francis Crick, who were
   also trying to determine the structure of DNA.

   The other scientists published a series of articles about the
   discovery, only mentioning Franklin's contributions in a footnote, and
   went on to receive the Nobel Prize, four years after Franklin's death.

Lise Meitner

   who helped discover nuclear fission, with her long-time research
   partner Otto Hahn. (Supplied: Wikimedia)

   A physicist specialising in radioactivity and nuclear physics, Lise
   Meitner built on the findings of famous French scientists Marie Curie
   and daughter Irene.

   Meitner moved from her native Austria to Berlin to study, but as a
   woman and a Jew, she was excluded from the main labs and lectures and
   had to conduct her work in the basement, studying radioactive elements
   with fellow scientist Otto Hahn.

   The pair worked out that when uranium atoms were bombarded with
   neutrons they split, releasing energy in what Meitner named "nuclear
   fission" â€” a discovery that eventually led to the invention of the
   atomic bomb and nuclear reactors.

   Meitner was forced to flee Nazi Germany to Sweden in 1938, but she and
   Hahn continued to collaborate from a distance. Their discovery of
   nuclear fission won Hahn the Nobel Prize in 1944, although Meitner was
   overlooked by the Nobel committee.

   She continued her research in Sweden into her 80s.

Dr Frances Oldham Kelsey

   1914 - 2015

   Pharmacologist Frances Oldham Kelsey saved countless children from
   birth defects by blocking the approval of thalidomide by the United
   States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
   [114]Frances Kelsey [115]Photo: Kelsey was a US Food and Drug
   Administration pharmacologist who blocked the approval of thalidomide
   in 1960. (Supplied: Wikimedia)

   Only a month after she started working for the FDA in 1960, Kelsey was
   tasked with reviewing an application for thalidomide, which was already
   in use in several other countries, including Australia, and was
   marketed as a morning sickness treatment for pregnant women.

   As Kelsey reviewed the drug approval application, she became uncertain
   it was as safe as was being claimed.

   She pushed back against pressure for the drug to be approved quickly,
   saying more research needed to be done.

   The drug was never approved in the US, but approximately 10,000
   children worldwide were born with deformities because of thalidomide
   use during pregnancy.

   Kelsey's story led to an amendment requiring stricter approval
   processes for FDA approval of new drugs and she was awarded the US's
   highest civilian honour by president John F Kennedy in 1962.

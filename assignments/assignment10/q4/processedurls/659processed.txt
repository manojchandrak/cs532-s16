   Almost three quarters of people polled by Sky News say they support a
   24-hour walkout by junior doctors.

   Some 1,380 people were asked if they either backed or opposed the
   strike in England - the second in a month over new contracts and
   weekend pay.

   The response was overwhelmingly in favour of a walkout.

   A total of 74% of those polled - within 45 minutes of the picket lines
   opening - said they supported the action, while 26% said they did not.

   The group were also asked if they agreed or disagreed with the
   following statement: "I would feel less safe than usual going to
   hospital today."

   Some 36% said they would feel less safe, while 64% said they would not.

   [34]More than 2,800 operations were postponed during the walkout but
   emergency departments were staffed.

   The results appeared to mirror the response at picket lines where many
   people joined striking medics outside hospitals or showed their support
   by beeping their car horns as they drove past and by bringing them hot
   beverages, biscuits and cake.

   It was a similar story on social media, with scores of people backing
   the action, including celebrities such as Harry Potter author JK
   Rowling.

   She posted a graphic on Twitter which read "I support the junior
   doctors #save the NHS".

   She added: "Speaking as a doctor's wife ..."

   Dr Johann Malawana, from the BMA, told Sky News: "Doctors in this
   country would never take industrial action without just cause, and it's
   clear that the population of the country are supportive of their
   doctors.

   "They don't want to see their doctors out on industrial action, we
   don't want to be out on industrial action, what we ask for the
   Government to do is to stop playing politics with the NHS and with
   junior doctors and actually address our concerns."

       Thousands of junior doctors across England are on strike after
       talks with the Government failed to reach an agreement on their
       contract. Many are posting images on social media with the hashtag
       #IAmTheDoctorWho. Continue through for more images

   However, there were also many unsympathetic tweets.

   One person wrote:  "Do I get paid more for working Saturday or Sunday?
   Nah."

   Another tweeted: "People have had their operations postponed because of
   the junior dr's strike :/ it's just wrong."

   Sky News also received many emails from people opposed to the strike.

   One person wrote: "When these people decided to become doctors did they
   not consider that they may have to work what they call unsocial hours?
   if they expected to  work "social hours" they should have chosen
   another profession."

   Another said: "If the doctors wanted a 9 to 5 job they should not have
   become doctors. An office type job could more appropriate maybe. of
   course a lot less money."

   Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has suggested he will bring in the new
   contract for junior doctors unless agreement is reached within the next
   few weeks.

   "We do need to have resolution on this ... the door is open for
   discussions and I think what we are proposing is going to mean that the
   vast majority of doctors don't see their pay cut, in fact many of them
   will see their pay go up," he said.

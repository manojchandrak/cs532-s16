Barrie non-profits out in the cold after crash

   "The car was fully embedded in the building"

   the organization has been displaced after a car crashed into its
   offices. Sue Sgambati/BarrieToday

   Sari Russell of Deaf Access Simcoe Muskoka stands in front of the
   gaping hole that used to be her office wall.

   Shortly after 10 p.m. Tuesday, a driver crashed through the Anne Street
   building which houses four non-profit agencies: Deaf Access Simcoe
   Muskoka, the CNIB, the Alzheimer Society and Catholic Family Services.

   The 39-year old man had to be extricated by Barrie Firefighters and
   Simcoe County Paramedics.

   Barrie Police later said he had suffered a medical emergency before the
   crash.

   "The car was fully embedded in the building," Russell said while
   considering herself lucky she wasn't sitting at her desk when it
   happened.

   "All four agencies are out of the building today," added the executive
   director who believes their displacement could be longer term.

   "I believe the other three will be able to re-enter tomorrow or Friday
   awaiting engineer's approval. But Deaf Access Services, we're not sure
   when our space will be ready for usage again."

   Russell says the agency is going to need all the help it can to
   re-establish its headquarters.

   In the short term, Deaf Access is urging its clients to call or email
   at info-@deafaccess.ca

   Russell hopes the organization can share some space with the other
   agencies in the building.

   Deaf Access Simcoe Muskoka services include sign-language
   interpretation and note-taking services for deaf and hard of hearing
   people for all of Simcoe County and Muskoka.

   Russell acknowledges the random crash is something she would never have
   imagined.

   "This was not on the scope of my job description when I took on this
   position but all in stride," said Russell. "Most importantly no was
   inside the building at the time. Our thoughts are with the man."

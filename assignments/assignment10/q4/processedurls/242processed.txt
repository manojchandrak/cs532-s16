   WASHINGTON--A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers said they are
   concerned about the Obama administration's decision last month to award
   a trademark for Havana Club rum to the Cuban government.

   In a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary
   Jacob Lew on Tuesday, Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R., Fla.) and Debbie
   Wasserman Schultz (D., Fla.), along with 23 other lawmakers, said they
   feared granting the trademark could undermine protections for American
   intellectual property rights holders.

   Most of the congressional signatories to the letter--17 of 25--are from
   Florida, where President Barack Obama's Cuba policy remains a divisive
   issue.

   Of the Democrats who signed on, eight of 11 are from Florida. Ms.
   Wasserman Schultz, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee,
   hasn't enthusiastically embraced Mr. Obama's policy shift with Cuba.
   She has said previously that she is considering the policy shift and
   hopes Mr. Obama will use it to press Cuba to improve human rights.

   "I've been firmly committed to protecting the intellectual property
   rights of American companies, and I was pleased to join this letter
   with Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and many of my Florida colleagues," she said
   in a separate statement, without singling out Cuba.

   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen said the U.S. decision to grant the trademark to Cuba
   was "politically motivated" by the Obama administration's move to
   normalize ties with Cuba.

   "This original family's factories and trademarks were confiscated by
   the Castro regime and the U.S. government should not take any action
   which would embolden any foreign entity that could confiscate U.S.
   trademarks and intellectual property," she said.

   The Office of Foreign Assets Control decided last month to grant a
   license to state-run Cubaexport to renew an expired trademark
   registration for Havana Club rum in a move that has reignited a
   decadeslong battle tension between Bacardi Ltd. and the Cuban
   government over the use of the Havana Club trademark in the U.S.

   Bacardi left Cuba after the 1959 revolution and later acquired the
   rights to the Havana Club trademark from its prerevolutionary owner,
   whose distillery was nationalized. The U.S. previously had recognized
   Bacardi's claim to the Havana Club name under a law that aims to
   protect owners of Cuban companies that were nationalized after the
   Cuban revolution.

   The decision to grant Cubaexport the trademark would allow the Cuban
   government to sell Cuban-made Havana Club in the U.S. for the first
   time in decades once the U.S. economic embargo on Cuba is lifted.

   That is unlikely to happen before President Barack Obama leaves office
   in 2017, but experts, lobbyists and lawmakers in favor of the shift
   have said they expect it will in the next five years.

   Bacardi had been selling Havana Club-branded rum in the U.S. since
   1994. That rum is made in Puerto Rico because of the economic embargo.
   Pernod Richard SA, which has a joint venture with the Cuban government,
   has been selling a Cuban-made version of the rum outside of the U.S.

   Amy Federman, a Bacardi spokeswoman, said, "Bacardi is pleased to see
   that members of Congress are standing up for property rights and
   looking into this issue."

   The company has filed a Freedom of Information Act request seeking
   records to explain why the U.S. decided to return the rights to use the
   name Havana Club back to the Cuban state company, which runs a joint
   venture with a global rival liquor company.

   On Thursday, Rep. Darrell Issa (R., Calif.), a signatory to the letter,
   will chair a hearing on the Havana Club trademark battle and property
   claims. U.S. and Cuban officials met to talk about billions of dollars
   of competing property claims for the first time last December.

   The claims, valued on the U.S. side to be between $7 billion and $8
   billion, are among the most contentious issues the two sides will
   address as they push for full normalization. Cuba, for its part, said
   at the United Nations this year it is owed about $121 billion for
   damages from the economic embargo.

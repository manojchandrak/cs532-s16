   NEW DELHI -- Millions of Indian children are getting deworming
   treatment in a massive national campaign to prevent parasitic worms
   from infecting them and impairing their mental and physical
   development.

   In a village on the outskirts of the Indian capital, the children
   washed their hands and lined up to chew the deworming tablets given to
   them by their teachers and health workers before opening their bags for
   studies on Wednesday morning.

   state of Rajsthan Wednesday, Feb. 10, 2016.

   The campaign is targeting 270 million children across the country for
   Wednesday's effort and another next week for children missed the first
   time, the Health Ministry said in a statement.

   Worms interfere with nutrient uptake in children and could lead to
   anemia, malnourishment and physical and mental impairment. The
   infection risk is mainly caused by lack of proper toilets, unclean
   drinking water, poor hygiene and dirty surroundings.

   The World Health Organization estimates that 220 million children
   between the ages of 1 and 14 are at risk of parasitic worm infection in
   India.

   On Wednesday, nearly 900,000 teachers, principals and health workers
   were mobilized in schools and government-sponsored child and mother
   care centers.

   The deworming initiative, along with measures to address hygiene and
   sanitation, would go a long way in improving the health of children as
   well as that of the country, said By Poonam Khetrapal Singh, the WHO
   Regional Director for South-East Asia.

   In a statement, Singh said India's campaign complements WHO's battle
   against neglected tropical diseases, those on the verge of elimination
   that continue to be public health challenges.

   Priya Jha, who leads non-governmental organization Evidence Action's
   work in India, said details of a second dose to the children would be
   decided soon by the Indian government on the basis of a study carried
   out in different states.

   She said the campaign went off smoothly with children and their parents
   eager to participate in it. The tablets were provided by the WHO and
   the Indian government.

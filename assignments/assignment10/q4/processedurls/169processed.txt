[14]Biss: An honor for President Obama to address the General Assembly

          Published: Wednesday, February 10, 2016 06:12 PM

   PresObama02102016 Sen. Daniel Biss (D-Evanston) issued the following
   statement about President Barack Obama’s address to the Illinois
   General Assembly in Springfield on Wednesday, Feb. 10, 2016:

   “President Barack Obama returned to Springfield today nine years after
   he announced his bid for the White House on the steps of the Old State
   Capitol. As he did in 2007, he called on each and every one of us to
   change our system of government for the better – something Americans
   have done time and again since our nation’s founding.

   “It was an honor for President Obama to address the Illinois General
   Assembly – the place where he began his career in public service – as
   he embarks on the final year of his presidency. I appreciate his timely
   call for collaboration and an elevated tone in government, and I look
   forward to being part of the conversation going forward.”

How the Other Half Loves at the Theatre Royal Haymarket

   February 9, 2016 Last updated: April 17, 2016 10:48 pm By [25]Neil

   How The Other Half Loves Produced by Bill Kenwright, a new revival of
   Alan Ayckbourn’s comedy How the Other Half Loves has been announced
   for the [26]Theatre Royal Haymarket from 23rd March to 21st June 2016,
   with official opening on 31st March 2016.

   “As Bob and Fiona clumsily try to cover up their affair, their spouses’
   intervention only adds to the confusion. William and Mary Featherstone
   become stuck in the middle, falsely accused of adultery and with no
   idea as to how they’ve become involved. The plot culminates in two
   disastrous dinner parties on successive nights, shown at the same time,
   after which the future of all three couples seems in jeopardy…”

   How The Other Half Loves concerns three couples: Frank and Fiona
   Foster; Bob and Teresa Phillips; William and Mary Featherstone. Frank
   employs both Bob and William and is considering promoting the latter.
   Bob is having an affair with Frank’s wife Fiona and is in constant
   conflict with his own wife, Teresa. She feels Bob is neglecting her
   while she raises their baby and is suspicious of his actions and
   phantom phone-calls made to the house. When he returns late, she
   confronts him about his actions and he lies that he has been comforting
   work associate William, who believes his wife Mary is having an affair.

   Frank and Fiona’s relationship is in stark contrast to the torrid
   emotions of Bob and Teresa’s. They share a polite, distant and evasive
   relationship and when Frank asks Fiona where she has also been, she
   says she has been comforting Mary – who she barely knows – who
   apparently believes William is having an affair. Of course, William and
   Mary are innocent parties and neither of the adulterers realise they
   have both implicated the Featherstones in their alibis. Both parties
   swear their partners to secrecy – particularly as both couples are
   entertaining the Featherstones on successive nights.

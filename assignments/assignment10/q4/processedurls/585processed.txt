   Giving flowers this Valentine's Day? We tested delivery services. Yahoo
   Finance Tuesday, February 9, 2016

   Looking to wow your loved one with that perfect bouquet on Valentine’s
   Day? We ordered a dozen roses from four different delivery services and
   asked Denise Porcaro, top-notch florist and founder of [3]Flower Girl
   NYC, to tell us who did it best.
   Here’s how they ranked:
   4th place: [4]ProFlowers
   To make it an apples-to-apples comparison, we ordered a dozen roses
   standing at least 16 inches tall in glass vases. For $34.99, ProFlowers
   quoted the lowest price with a “7 days freshness guaranteed.” With the
   vase, service and delivery fees, the total came to $65.28 -- which was
   still about $30 less than the other services.
   But when it came in the mail, our experience was thornier than
   expected. It was the only bouquet out of the bunch that came in a box
   and 3 out of the 12 roses were already wilting.
   “This looks like poor hydration to me,” says Porcaro. “There’s a thin
   vein that runs through the flowers, the stem itself, and that’s how the
   flowers drink so they need a fresh cut to expose that again to the
   fresh water.”
   To be fair, we didn’t cut the stems before we placed them in a vase
   full of water. But we did throw in the flower food packet, though it
   didn’t do much to revive them.
   While they were most affordable option, the website’s photo and
   description did not make it seem any lower in quality than the others.
   In the end, we decided to call customer service to complain. After two
   phone calls, and forty-five minutes on the phone, we were able to
   receive the full refund.
   3rd place: [5]Teleflora
   Teleflora sources its flowers from local florists to fulfill orders.
   The roses we got were stunning, in full bloom, and double the size of
   ProFlowers’ roses. Because the vase was lined with green leaves, the
   overall presentation looked more polished. For $77.95, we ordered the
   “deluxe bouquet” for the same 16-inch long-stem roses. With fees, the
   total came to $96.94.
   The only reason this bouquet didn’t rate higher was because of the
   bruised brown petals on the outermost layers of some roses. From the
   grower to the florist, these “packing petals” are left remaining as
   they travel long distances. But Porcaro says this outer layer should’ve
   been peeled off before they were sent.
   2nd place: [6]1-800-flowers
   Standing 22 inches tall, these roses looked garden-fresh and were
   cleaned properly. For $69.99, the entire arrangement looked just like
   it did in the website’s photo.
   Aesthetically, Porcaro would’ve gone with accents other than the Baby’s
   Breath that were part of this bouquet. “If you're using the right
   greenery, like steel grass or seeded eucalyptus, you can actually
   enhance the bouquet,” says Porcaro. Overall, for a total $92.52, we
   felt we got what we paid for.
   1st place: A local florist
   From placing the order to receiving the flowers, going local was the
   best overall experience. Prices were comparable to the 2nd and 3rd
   place bouquets, but the local vendor sent us the most vibrant roses at
   24 inches tall.
   No roses, no vases, no delivery
   With or without roses, Valentine’s Day can get expensive fast. Whether
   it’s your local flower shop or the deli on the corner, there’s going to
   be a big markup for flowers because of high demand. To save without
   skimping on quality, Porcaro recommends going to your local florist and
   asking them to arrange a hand-tied bouquet within your budget. Without
   roses, vases, or delivery fees, you’ll be able to save at least $30.
   To make sure you send your loved one the best flowers, Porcaro says
   it’s about quality control. “Valentine’s Day is not the day to chance
   it. Go with what you know,” she says.

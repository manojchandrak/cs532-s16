There is need to institutionalise judiciary reform – Adedeji

   On [62]February 11, 201612:58 amIn [63]Law & Human Rights, [64]News by
   [65]Tony Chinonso[66]Comments

   Ade A. Adedeji  is a Senior Advocate of Nigeria. He  is a highly
   skilled litigation and corporate commercial lawyer. The Learned Silk
   has distinguished himself in several areas of the legal Practice and he
   is currently involved in many contentious litigation for both  local
   and international corporate entities. In this interview, he spoke on
   the judiciary budget in 2016; the need to institutionalize   judicial
   reform and  infrastructural challenges facing the institution as well
   as other related issues. Excerpts:

   By Bartholomew Madukwe

   PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari has said that the judiciary is his biggest
   headache in the fight against corruption, what is your reaction to
   this?

   The judiciary as an institution is a victim of the society. Why do I
   say so? Quite often, the judiciary receives all sort of knocks from
   parties when decisions do not swing in their favour. I want to believe
   that the reason for this statement by the President, with due respect,
   has to do with certain decisions of the court, which of course are not
   in favour of government at this time.

   Judicial reform
   Adedeji- We have to make a choice as individuals Adedeji- We have to
   make a choice as individuals Adedeji- We have to make a choice as
   individuals

   Therefore, I am not surprised that the judiciary is getting a knock on
   the head doing what it ought to do.

   There is no doubt that the need for judicial reforms have become very
   urgent and important, especially to strengthen the fight against
   corruption. However, are you satisfied with the way corruption cases
   are being handled?

   To be honest with you, in my opinion, judicial reform needs to be
   institutionalised. As part of political reform of the country’s
   judiciary, it must constantly be reviewed or reformed to reflect the
   constant dynamics of the society. It should not be treated like one off
   project and be left in a state for a century. Efficient justice
   delivery is central to the nation’s economic growth and development.
   The administration of justice in Nigeria craves for serious reform to
   meet with the exigencies of growth; hence delay of cases in courts and
   in some cases failure to deliver justice.

   The Federal Government has budget N70 billion for the entire nation’s
   judiciary in the 2016 budget, which is N3billion lower than the
   73billion appropriated for it in 2015. What is your reaction to this?

   My opinion is that this is not in conformity with Mr President’s
   promise when he came to power and said he was going to reform the
   judiciary. I wish that the government will drive home the point that a
   lot will be done in the coming year, starting from this year, for the
   judiciary. Of course, money has to be spent. In a situation where the
   budget of the judiciary is dwindling by the year, then I think that, if
   anything at all, it will negate the expectations of many of us.

   We have seen conflicting judgements  from the Court of Appeal,
   especially on election petitions issues.  What is your view on this?

   There is nothing conflicting about the judgement of the Court of
   Appeal. The judgement of the Court of Appeal can be reversed at the
   Supreme Court, which was exactly what happened. There is nothing new or
   strange about it.

   Constitutional power

   The system of adjudication that we have, puts the Supreme Court in a
   position to review judgements of the Court of Appeal, and where
   something is amiss, they have constitutional power to reverse such
   judgement. That was exactly what happened in the Rivers and Abia State
   governorship elections. The judgement was reversed as they rightly view
   it.

   Does this suggest that some judges of the Court of Appeal lack basic
   knowledge of the law, hence, their judgements are reversed as seen in
   the Rivers and Abia State governorship elections?

   I do not believe that a justice of the Court of Appeal lacks basic
   knowledge of the law because his judgement was reversed by the Supreme
   Court. Yes indeed, I have read in newspapers that there are certain
   conflicting judgements from different panels of the Court of Appeals.
   Those judgements could be conflicting among panels of the Court of
   Appeal and I think that is what happened. The card reader was not
   contemplated at the time of the passing of the law. What is expected
   from the electronic card reader should now be part of the Electoral
   Law.

   Undoubtedly, the infrastructural challenges facing the Nigerian
   judiciary are enormous and addressing them should be done holistically
   by the National Judicial Institute and various administrative heads of
   the judiciary, but how would you describe the state of infrastructure
   of courts across the country?

   You have just said it the way it is. The advantage is that we have a
   Vice President, who is not only experienced in this issue by virtue of
   his track record, but also committed to getting us there. From what
   happened in Lagos State for instance, I remember the Lagos judiciary of
   15 and 20 years ago and I know what it is today. Within that period,
   sometimes lawyers would not bringing their clients to court because
   they did not want them to come and see its poor state.

   But now I know of judges who can confidently say that nobody can walk
   into their chambers to influence their decision. The Vice President did
   all that as Attorney General of Lagos State and I believe he is going
   to do it again. As Vice President, I believe he has enough power to
   ensure that all these things are put in place.

   Infrastructural development

   I totally agree that there is need for infrastructural development
   across the board; not only at the federal level but even at the state,
   including the customary court. I believe that we have a huge advantage
   and that should be done in coming years.

   Since inception of the administration, we have seen the EFCC arrest
   suspects and take them to court. But after the court grants bail and
   same is perfected, such persons are re-arrested and charged again. In
   some cases, the suspect is asked to return certain money to the
   commission before any release can be made. What do you make of this?

   Few days ago I was looking at the Administration of Criminal Justice
   Act, you may be shocked that the new law actually allows for that. I am
   one of the people who argue that the EFCC, as it is today, should be
   restructured to enable them  function more effectively. I do not think
   they are on top of the game. I do not think they are effectively
   performing their duties as expected by the citizenry of this country.

   One thing is very clear, the EFCC of 2016 is better than what it used
   to be in the past. We never hear of cases of high calibre politicians
   being openly prosecuted, but now you can see the kingpins are being
   prosecuted everyday, charged, and some of them convicted. I think that
   is the direction. I can only imagine that as years roll by, more and
   more will be done to actually give more confidence. Before then, we
   need to have our eyes on the ball to continue working hard on what we
   have and develop them.

   Do you have any fear in this administration’s programme of ‘change’?

   Looking at the men and women in government today, which I am not saying
   that we won’t have discomfort, I have anxieties and do not have any
   doubt whatsoever of their doing well. I know for a fact that any
   government that decides to fight corruption is going to encounter a lot
   of resistance and I think that is exactly what is going on.

   Responsible citizens

   If you want to fight the established institution, you must be ready
   because they are going to show you and hit you. That is exactly what is
   happening. We have to make a choice as individuals, as responsible
   citizens of this country, whether we want to go forward or back to what
   it used to be. In which case, of course, we must constantly remind
   ourselves that if we decide to go back our future generation will not
   be happy with us because we have a chance to go forward.

   The issue of creating state police remains an argument and many
   Nigerians have said that such is what is needed today. What is your own
   position?

   I think everybody knows this as a fact that the country is under
   policed. Most of the time people get away with murder in every aspect
   of our lives. Yes, I believe that the creation of state police is
   now. We can then look at which of the police is to handle what matter.
   Whether we like it or not, we have reached a point where the state is
   constitutionally empowered to have a state police. Since independence
   in 1960, a lot of things have changed. You need a lot to be able to
   control some of these crimes which are intelligence driven.

   You really cannot afford to wait for all the bureaucracy in a single
   police structure to control a lot of things. I think we have passed
   that stage and we need to come into full realization of the fact that
   we have moved from that age. This is a new age, a lot of things have to
   change before we can really say that we are serious in combating
   crimes.

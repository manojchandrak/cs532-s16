   BART admits 77 percent of train cameras are fake or don’t work
   1 / 14
   Back to Gallery

   Fewer than a quarter of what appear to be surveillance cameras inside
   BART train cars are real and functional, transit agency officials said
   Tuesday.

   BART detailed exactly how many of its train cameras actually record
   footage in response to a public records request that The Chronicle
   filed after [240]revealing the agency had been relying for years on
   scores of decoy cameras to fool criminals and commuters.

   After acknowledging that most of the security devices on trains were
   dummies — but defending the strategy — BART officials [241]said they
   would phase out the fakes and replace them with working cameras at a
   cost of $1.4 million.

   Each train car now has a set of four devices that appear to be cameras,
   mounted to the ceilings.

   But BART said Tuesday that just 22.6 percent of the cars had working
   camera systems. The agency said 70 percent of cameras were fakes, and
   that others were either broken or inactive.

   The Chronicle [242]revealed the decoy program after learning that BART
   had failed to film the Jan. 9 fatal shooting of a man aboard a train at
   the West Oakland Station.

   The slaying of 19-year-old Carlos Misael Funez-Romero of Antioch
   remains unsolved despite a $10,000 reward. Four days after the killing,
   BART police released photos of the suspect that were taken by station
   cameras as he entered the system in Pittsburg and as he left the West
   Oakland Station.

   Investigators have discovered that the suspect and victim both boarded
   at the Pittsburg/Bay Point Station, 30 miles away, after riding the
   same Tri Delta Transit bus to the station.

   The men — who were captured by cameras on the bus — had some sort of
   “interaction” that apparently continued until the 7:40 p.m. shooting,
   BART said. But the relationship between the men, if any, as well as the
   motive for the killing, remain unknown.

   The suspect, a tall, thin black man with close-cut hair, appeared to be
   wearing a dark green jacket with a hood, a backpack, jeans and beige
   work-style boots.

   The use of dummy cameras is common in private security but unusual
   among transit systems. And although BART’s use of the decoys was an
   open secret at the agency, many officials, including some board
   members, were unaware of it.

   BART is replacing its entire fleet of trains, and officials said every
   car in the new fleet will be equipped with cutting-edge cameras
   producing footage that can be watched live from a central monitoring
   station. Those cars are expected to arrive between 2017 and 2021.

   Also Tuesday, BART said it did not rely on decoy cameras outside of its
   train cars.

   It said that 10 stations had extensive camera systems and that those
   stations were each outfitted with between 68 and 85 cameras. All the
   cameras are believed to be functional, officials said. An additional 16
   cameras are mounted at “sensitive” sites around the BART system,
   officials said.

   BART did not provide the exact location of all cameras, citing concern
   that the information could aid terrorists. It also did not give the age
   of every camera, citing a lack of accurate records.

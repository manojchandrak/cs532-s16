Parents urged to boycott VTech toys after hack

   By Leo Kelion Technology desk editor
     * 10 February 2016
     * From the section [58]Technology

   access to its Learning Lodge software

   Cybersecurity experts have said parents should boycott or at least be
   cautious of VTech's electronic toys because of how it has handled a
   hack attack.

   They gave the advice after it emerged that VTech's new terms and
   conditions state that parents must assume responsibility for future
   breaches.

   More than 6.3 million children's accounts were affected by last year's
   breach, which gave the perpetrator access to photos and chat logs.

   VTech says it stands by the new terms.

   "Since learning about the hack of its databases, VTech has worked hard
   to enhance the security of its websites and services and to safeguard
   customer information," said a spokeswoman.

   "But no company that operates online can provide a 100% guarantee that
   it won't be hacked.

   "The Learning Lodge terms and conditions, like the T&Cs for many online
   sites and services, simply recognise that fact by limiting the
   company's liability for the acts of third parties such as hackers.

   "Such limitations are commonplace on the web."

'Full responsibility'

   The new terms were flagged by a [59]blog by the Australian security
   specialist Troy Hunt.

   In it, he detailed additional flaws with VTech's products and alleged
   that it was misleading for the firm to have described the attack as
   being "sophisticated".
   Image copyright VTech Image caption VTech has said 6.3 million
   children's accounts and 4.9 million parents' accounts were affected by
   the hack attack

   He also disclosed that the company had issued new [60]terms and
   conditions on 24 December for the software that lets parents add apps
   to its devices and copy off photos and other saved files.

   They tell parents:

   "You acknowledge and agree that you assume full responsibility for your
   use of the site and any software or firmware downloaded.

   "You acknowledge and agree that any information you send or receive
   during your use of the site may not be secure and may be intercepted or
   later acquired by unauthorised parties.

   "You acknowledge and agree that your use of the site and any software
   or firmware downloaded there from is at your own risk."
   Image copyright Scott Helme Image caption The terms and conditions are
   displayed as part of the InnoTab Max firmware update

   Another security researcher, Scott Helme, later confirmed the terms
   appeared when Europe-based owners of the VTech's InnoTab Max tablets
   updated its firmware.

   Mr Hunt was dismayed.

   "People don't even read these things!" he wrote.

   "If [VTech] honestly feel they're not up to the task of protecting
   personal information, then perhaps put that on the box and allow
   consumers to consciously take their chances rather than implicitly
   opting into the 'zero accountability' clause."

'Unforgiveable and ignorant'

   His condemnation of the firm has since been echoed by four other
   security experts.

   "This is an unbelievably arrogant and derogatory response considering
   their track record with data security," said Ken Munro from Pen Test
   Partners.

   "If VTech think that those T&Cs are the answer to their problems I
   think they should be given a bigger problem to deal with. Boycott them
   and take your money somewhere else."

   Prof Angela Sasse - director of the UK Research Institute in Science of
   Cyber Security - added that she would be "cautious" about all of the
   firm's products.
   Image copyright VTech Image caption VTech also makes home monitoring
   and security products

   "The nature of the security flaws identified, and their displayed lack
   of urgency in fixing them, casts doubt on their security competence,"
   she told the BBC.

   "Instead, they change the T&Cs to 'dump' any risk on their customers -
   I would not trust a vendor who behaves in this way."

   University College London's Dr Steven Murdoch also guided potential
   shoppers elsewhere.

   "The existence of vulnerabilities that result from beginners' mistakes
   in the VTech website is disappointing, as is their handling of the
   situation, so it raises serious questions about whether there are
   vulnerabilities in their other products," he said.

   "It would be understandable that potential customers will look
   elsewhere."

   Meanwhile, Trend Micro's Rik Ferguson said the firm's behaviour was
   "unforgivable, ignorant and indefensible".

   "Would I advise consumers to avoid an organisation that attempts to
   take advantage of its customers' goodwill and to absolve itself of its
   legal responsibilities with weasel words? Unequivocally, yes."
   Media captionBBC's Rory Cellan-Jones attempted to interview VTech
   manager Rebecca Lazarus in January

   A lawyer added that VTech's approach was "odd".

   "It's unusual to see these terms in consumer contracts and it's
   questionable if they would be enforceable," said Callum Murray, head of
   commercial technology at Kemp Little.

Under scrutiny

   VTech's reach is about to grow following a deal to take over its US
   rival Leapfrog, which makes child-centric tablets computers,
   smartwatches and apps of its own.

   But one company-watcher commented that the impact went even further.
   Image copyright Leapfrog Image caption VTech has agreed to buy its US
   rival Leapfrog in a deal worth $72m (Â£50m)

   "A lot of eyes are on VTech because nothing on this kind of scale has
   happened in the toy industry before," said Billy Langsworthy, editor of
   the Toy News trade magazine.

   "Toy firms need to be aware that these kinds of cyber-attacks are going
   to become more common, so right from how they set up their security to
   how they deal with the PR of a breach is something that this sector is
   going to have to look at."

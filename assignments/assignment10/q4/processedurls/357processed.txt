   Predicting a Bear Market?

Am I Predicting a Bear Market?

   Posted on 10 February 2016. Category | [60]Stock Market

   No. I think I’m watching it happen right now. As you may recall, in my
   [61]2016 Fearless Forecast, I predicted we’d see a recession. I think
   we’re already in one: the recent volatility seems to be validating it.
   I also said the Dow would drop to 11,500 this year, which doesn’t sound
   as crazy as it did at the beginning of the year—and remember, I'm the
   same guy that anticipated the Dow at 7,000 back in 2008. It sounded
   crazy then, too. And I’m not someone who sees bear markets around every
   corner. If you’ve read my Fearless Forecasts over the years, I’ve been
   very bullish on many occasions.

   What makes me think we’re in a bear market? The first clue: Governments
   around the world are printing money, borrowing money, and instigating
   negative interest rates. Would they be doing that if everything were
   fine?  I think this global stimulus tells us that the world economies
   are not in good shape.

   Next clue: The US economy has slowed down. It was growing at about 2
   percent in the third quarter of 2015, and slowed to a .7 percent
   annualized rate in the fourth quarter of last year. We are barely
   keeping our head above water, and I think the global economy could pull
   us under.

   We also have negative growth. Companies’ profits shrunk for the fourth
   quarter in a row, and earnings per share dropped for the third
   consecutive quarter in a row. On top of this negative growth trend,
   global corporate debt is now so high that companies can't borrow enough
   to fix their problems, and they're being downgraded.  The S&P just
   announced that they are downgrading more corporations around the world
   than they have since the worst of the credit crisis in 2009.

   You can see why I think this is a very dangerous time in the stock
   market.  Recessions bring bear markets and if we have the average bear
   market drop of 35 percent, that will put the Dow at 11,500.  In my
   opinion, the foundation upon which the stock market is standing is
   sand, and it's slowly dribbling away. It’s getting very,

   very dicey out there.

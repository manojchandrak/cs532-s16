   With the [5]salary cap projected to jump to $90 million next season,
   the [6]Chicago Bulls appear interested in using the influx of cash to
   retain their talent.

   Re-signing [7]Pau Gasol is a priority for Chicago, and the Bulls are
   willing to offer the 7-foot Spaniard a contract worth $20 million per
   year, [8]ESPN's Brian Windhorst said on the "Waddle & Silvy Show."

   At 35 years of age, it's unlikely the term of the deal would run more
   than a few years, especially given the the high dollar value.

   Gasol has put together another good year with the Bulls, [9]earning his
   sixth All-Star selection Tuesday after teammate [10]Jimmy Butler was
   ruled out. The 14-year veteran is averaging 17 points, 10.9 rebounds,
   two blocks, and 42.3 percent from three.

   If Gasol re-signs at $20 million per year, the Bulls will have almost
   $60 million committed to three players for next season, with
   [11]Derrick Rose and [12]Jimmy Butler earning $38.875 million between
   them.

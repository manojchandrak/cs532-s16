   Harviestoun Brewery MD Toby Knowles 26 Apr 16

   [50]Andy Morton Harviestoun Brewery was founded in 1983 in Alva

   Scotland, already well-known for the quality of its whisky, is carving
   out a reputation as a centre of craft beer excellence. According to
   Nielsen data, craft beer consumers in Scotland drink more per head than
   almost anywhere else in the UK, and every year an increasing number of
   new breweries open to accommodate this thirst. Last year, there were 93
   breweries in Scotland, the Campaign for Real Ale, says, with 20 of them
   opening over the past 12 months.

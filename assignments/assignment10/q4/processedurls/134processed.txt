NCRI WOMEN'S COMMITTEE

   Works extensively with Iranian women outside the country and maintains
   a permanent contact with women inside Iran. The Women’s Committee is
   actively involved with many women's rights organizations and NGO's and
   the Iranian diaspora. The committee is a major source of much of the
   information received from inside Iran with regards to women. Attending
   UN Human Rights Commission meetings and other international or regional
   conferences on women’s issues, and engaging in a relentless battle
   against the Iranian regime's misogyny are part of the activities of
   members and associates of the committee.

Saudi arms deal exempt from global treaty, Ottawa says [38]Add to ...

   Canada’s controversial $15-billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia will be
   exempt from a global arms trade treaty that the Trudeau Liberals
   promised they would sign if they won office, Foreign Affairs Minister
   Stéphane Dion’s department says.

   This means Canada’s biggest military export contract, to supply
   weaponized armoured vehicles to a country regularly ranked by Freedom
   House as among the “worst of the worst” on human rights, will not be
   subject to what experts say are stricter export controls in the Arms
   Trade Treaty.

   This matters in the Saudi deal because Ottawa must authorize exports of
   combat vehicles to Riyadh, and critics say it’s easier to do so under
   Canada’s current export control regime – where the government has the
   authority to override its own guidelines on shipping weapons to
   countries with poor human-rights records.

   A spokesman for the department of Global Affairs said the General
   Dynamics Land Systems deal – first announced in 2014 but still in its
   early stages – is not covered by the 2014 Arms Trade Treaty because
   Canada has yet to actually sign on to the agreement.

   “The Arms Trade Treaty does not apply to this specific contract as
   Canada is not yet a state party to the Arms Trade Treaty,” Global
   Affairs spokesman François Lasalle said.

   Paul Meyer, a former Canadian diplomat with 35 years’ experience in the
   foreign service, said this doesn’t make sense. He said it’s standard
   practice for countries to begin complying with the rules of treaties
   once they make it clear they intend to sign them.

   “The normal conduct in diplomacy is if a government says it intends to
   adhere to a treaty, that it conducts itself in accordance with those
   provisions,” Mr. Meyer, now an adjunct professor at Simon Fraser
   University, said.

   Mr. Dion’s mandate letter from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, made
   public in November, instructs him to formally commit Canada to the
   treaty.

   But Mr. Dion’s department, Global Affairs, said this will take time.

   “In order to accede to the treaty … Canada must ensure that it has put
   in place domestically all legislation or regulations that would be
   required to ensure that we can fully meet the obligations of the
   treaty. Officials are currently undertaking internal legislative and
   policy reviews in order to identify those changes that might be
   necessary for Canada to accede to the ATT,” Mr. Lasalle said.

   Ottawa still has a big role to play in the Saudi deal.

   Global Affairs must issue export permits to allow the shipment of the
   combat vehicles to Riyadh once they are ready to be transported abroad.
   It can only do so after it’s determined there are no risks to human
   rights in Saudi Arabia, where the government has dispatched armoured
   vehicles to help crush uprisings in neighbouring Bahrain and quell
   dissent in its restless Eastern Province. The Saudis also face fresh
   accusations of indiscriminately killing civilians in Yemen by air
   strikes.

   Even though Global Affairs says it needs more time to sign on to the
   United Nations-backed accord, the department insists its existing
   arms-control regime is already robust.

   “Canada already meets most of the obligations of the Arms Trade
   Treaty,” Global Affairs spokeswoman Rachna Mishra said.

   Critics disagree, saying the language of the Arms Trade Treaty is
   stronger than the Canadian government’s current rules for restricting
   exports of weapons. The global treaty came into force 14 months ago,
   but Canada didn’t sign on at the time; the former Conservative
   government argued Canada “already has some of the strongest export
   controls in the world.”

   Ken Epps, a policy adviser on the Arms Trade Treaty with Project
   Ploughshares, an anti-war group that monitors arms exports, said
   current Canadian export regulations only oblige Ottawa to “closely
   control” the shipment of military goods to countries with a persistent
   record of human-right violations. He calls that a “loose arrangement”
   that gives the government too much leeway to override export controls
   and overlook findings on the risks to human rights in Saudi Arabia.

   Under Article 7 of the Arms Trade Treaty, however, Canada will be
   obliged to “assess the potential that convention arms … could be used
   to commit a serious violation of international human-rights law” and
   other factors – and if there is an “overriding risk of any of the
   negative consequences,” the country in question “shall not authorize
   the export.”

   Mr. Epps also said the Canadian government is wrong. He notes that even
   after Canada has acceded to the treaty, it has an ongoing
   responsibility to monitor events in Saudi Arabia and to suspend export
   permits or refuse to issue new ones if warranted by the human-rights
   risks in the Mideast country.

   NDP foreign affairs critic Hélène Laverdière said the Liberals are
   trying to dodge tougher rules on export controls and on transparency by
   saying the global arms trade treaty will not apply to the Saudi deal.

Los Angeles passes $1.9bn bill to tackle homeless crisis

     * 10 February 2016
     * From the section [61]US & Canada

   are up to 20,000 homeless people in LA city, with another 20,000 on the
   streets in the wider county

   Los Angeles, known as the homeless capital of the US, has passed a
   $1.87bn (£1.29bn) plan to help get an estimated 40,000 people off the
   streets.

   City authorities hope to expand homeless shelters and build quality
   housing over the next 10 years.

   It is "the most serious humanitarian crisis confronting our county
   today," city official Sachi Hamai said.

   LA [62]declared a state of public emergency last year as the number of
   homeless people soared by 12.4% in two years.

   Residents and officials say a mixture of unemployment, drugs and rising
   rents and house prices are to blame for the growing problem.

   As many as 40,000 homeless people are predicted to be living in the
   whole of Los Angeles county, two-thirds of which either live in the
   street, in tents or in cars.

   people access to basic utilities such as showers and toilets

   Measures to be introduced as part of a 10-year-plan include investing
   in short and long-term housing, allowing overnight parking for people
   living inside their vehicles, and creating a city-wide network of
   mobile showers and toilets.

   Officials are to release $150m over the next two years, which will be
   earmarked for housing the homeless. Some lawmakers are questioning the
   source of the funds, but the city's mayor has indicated that it could
   come from new revenue and by shifting existing funds.

   "It may include things that have to do with revenue growth or the
   shifting of priorities of money. We don't have 100 million extra
   dollars lying around where we can go, 'OK we were going to split this
   up into other things, let's just put it all into homelessness.' It will
   require difficult decisions," Mayor Eric Garcetti said.

   The plans still need to be adopted by the city, which will not be
   voting on its budget until April.

   Los Angeles already spends some $1bn a year on medical, psychiatric and
   social welfare costs on its homeless residents.

'A city of shanties' - James Cook, BBC News, Los Angeles

   The City of Angels has another nickname: the homeless capital of
   America.

   The accuracy of the title may be disputed - there are many ways to
   count, none of them definitive - but no one else wants it, and it has
   stuck.

   The heart of this capital is in the shadows, beneath the gleaming
   skyscrapers, on Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles.

   In this land of glitz and glamour, the forgotten people have made camp.

   Block after block, the homeless and their scant belongings -
   tarpaulins, tents and trolleys - are scattered on the concrete in the
   baking sun. Most of the faces are African-American.

   [185]Donald Trump woke up to more than just [186]a win in the New
   Hampshire primary Wednesday: [187]Funny or Die have unleashed their
   50-minute film The Art of the Deal: The Movie, a faux-biopic centered
   around the mogul's best-selling business book starring [188]Johnny
   Depp in the role of Trump.

   WTF Happened in the New Hampshire Primary, Explained »

   "Thought to be lost in the Cybill Shepherd blouse fire of '89, The Art
   of the Deal was a TV movie based on the best-selling Donald Trump
   autobiography of the same name. In fact, it was written, directed and
   starred Donald Trump himself," filmmaker Ron Howard, who serves as the
   feature's narrator, jokingly tells the audience. "But The Art of the
   Deal was almost never seen; it was preempted by Monday Night Football
   in 1988… Trump was furious, and vowed never to air his masterpiece. It
   disappeared for decades, before it turned up at a yard sale in Phoenix,
   Arizona."

   Following an authentically Eighties, Kenny Loggins-penned theme song,
   the biopic focuses in on the film's main plot: Trump's persistent
   efforts to purchase Atlantic City's Taj Mahal from Merv Griffin. At the
   five-minute mark, the audience finally encounters their first look at
   Depp as Trump, a startlingly nuanced impression that only an
   Oscar-nominated actor could deliver.

   The short film also stars Patton Oswalt as Griffin, former Saturday
   Night Live cast member Michaela Watkins as Ivana Trump plus appearances
   by Henry Winkler, Jack McBrayer, Andy Richter, Alfred Molina and more.

   [189]Speaking to the New York Times about The Art of the Deal: The
   Movie, Funny of Die co-founder Adam McKay said, "It was a crazy,
   completely nuts idea that somehow we pulled off." Depp's scenes were
   shot over four days in December during a brief window in the actor's
   schedule.

   As for how they kept the project a secret, Funny or Die's
   editor-in-chief Owen Burke said, "We had a few people sign
   nondisclosures, but mostly we just begged people not to say anything."
   Burke also called Depp's performance "absolutely bananas."

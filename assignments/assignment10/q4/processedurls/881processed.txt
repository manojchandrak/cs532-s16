     * Fiorina suspends Republican presidential campaign

     Former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina said Wednesday
     that she is suspending her campaign for the Republican presidential
     nomination, following a lackluster showing in the New Hampshire
     primary.

     Fiorina, 61, had pitched herself as an outsider who could bring a
     business mentality and global contacts to the White House — and who
     would not be afraid to attack the Democratic front-runner, Hillary
     Clinton. But she was badly outspent, as she was unable to translate
     strong debate performances and enthusiastic crowds in early
     appearances in key primary states into sustained poll momentum — or
     into votes, coming in seventh in both the Iowa caucuses, with less
     than 2 percent of the vote, and in New Hampshire, with 4 percent.

     "While I suspend my candidacy today, I will continue to travel this
     country and fight for those Americans who refuse to settle for the
     way things are and a status quo that no longer works for them,"
     Fiorina said in a Facebook post announcing her decision.

     Fiorina's campaign had been presented with a key opportunity last
     fall after two strong debate performances that showcased her direct
     delivery style and command of the issues powered a rise in the
     polls. In the undercard round of the first GOP debate of the season,
     in August in Cleveland, she won enough support to propel her onto
     the main stage for September's CNN-sponsored debate at the Reagan
     Presidential Library in California.

     There, she went toe to toe with businessman Donald Trump, who had
     made disparaging comments about her appearance to Rolling Stone
     magazine. He tried to explain away the remark, but Fiorina pushed
     back. "I think women all over this country heard very clearly what
     Mr. Trump said," she said, to sustained applause.

     Her debate performance caught the attention of social conservatives
     with attacks on Planned Parenthood and abortion. At her peak, in
     early October, polls showed her in second place in New Hampshire,
     according to an average of surveys compiled by Real Clear Politics.
     In Iowa and South Carolina, she placed third.

     But with Trump monopolizing media attention - and a
     business-oriented outsider label - and without the deep campaign
     organization of the other leading candidates, Fiorina saw her
     opportunity slip away, as she hovered for months at 3 percent or
     less in surveys of most early-voting states. Last month, she offered
     Trump $2 million to return to the debate stage following his
     announcement that he would skip the Fox News Channel faceoff in Des
     Moines. The offer passed with little notice.

     At the heart of Fiorina's campaign pitch was her experience at the
     helm of Hewlett-Packard from 1999 to 2005 — the first woman to lead
     such a massive corporation. But a particular challenge was her mixed
     record at the company. Hewlett-Packard, like many technology firms
     at the time, struggled through the bursting of the dot-com bubble.
     She oversaw a controversial merger with Compaq before being forced
     out in February 2005, receiving a $21 million severance package.

     Page 2 of 2 - Her time as an adviser to Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
     during his 2008 presidential bid was also rocky. She defended
     McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin, against attacks she said were
     "sexist" — but was yanked off the television circuit after she said,
     in response to a question, that neither McCain nor Palin would be
     able to run a major corporation.

     In November 2009, Fiorina — who had just beaten cancer and lost her
     stepdaughter to drug addiction — announced that she would challenge
     Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., for her seat. Her struggles in that
     race foreshadowed her challenges as a presidential candidate: Even
     with her vast web of wealthy connections, she struggled to raise as
     much money as Boxer and chipped in millions of her own. Boxer was
     resoundingly reelected in 2010.

     In New Hampshire, where Fiorina focused much of her attention during
     her presidential bid, she had long languished in the low single
     digits - even as she conceded that her candidacy hinged on her
     ability to overperform there and elsewhere.

     She also struggled to reach voters who were focused more on national
     security after the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino,
     Calif. Fiorina touted her credentials as an adviser to the Defense
     Department and the State Department, and invariably described the
     Israeli prime minister as "my good friend Bibi Netanyahu." But most
     voters viewed her primarily as a businesswoman.

     Her campaign relied heavily on an independent super PAC called CARLY
     for America for traditional campaign activities - a strategy that
     may have segregated the candidate from the grass-roots elements of
     her campaign, making it more difficult for her to build on the buzz
     generated by the debates in a focused and nimble way. The campaign
     and the super PAC also were slow to reinforce Fiorina's debate
     messages with ads that might have boosted her name recognition among
     Republicans at a time when interest in her was spiking, announcing
     its first New Hampshire ad buy in early December. By then, it was
     too late.

     "She sort of had a moment, then she faded," Katie Packer Gage,
     former deputy campaign manager for Mitt Romney, said in December.

     Late in the campaign, Fiorina used her underdog status to highlight
     her chief closing argument. "The establishment thinks it owns this
     country," she said at the Fox News debate last month. "The pundits
     thinks they own this country. The media thinks they own this
     country. We were intended to be a citizen government, citizens. The
     game is rigged. You have the power. Take our country back."

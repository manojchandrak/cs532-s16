   Senators put aside party politics on Wednesday and overwhelmingly voted
   to back a bill aimed at derailing North Korea's quest for a nuclear
   weapon.

   The vote was 96 to 0.

   Republican presidential candidates Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of
   Florida returned to Washington for the vote. Democratic candidate
   Bernie Sanders of Vermont did not.

   In statement Wednesday, Sanders said, "While I will be necessarily
   absent for the expected bipartisan passage of the bill, I strongly
   support the North Korea sanctions legislation."

   But Jesse Ferguson, a spokesman for Sanders' Democratic rival, Hillary
   Clinton, said, "It is unfortunate that yet again, Senator Sanders has
   shown a lack of interest in vital national security issues, failing to
   vote on sanctions against the country he said poses the greatest threat
   to the United States."

   Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, and Dick Durbin,
   D-Ill, also did not vote.

   The bill would mandate sanctions against those involved in North
   Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile development program, require a
   renewed focus on cyber-attacks committed by North Korea on the United
   States and target those responsible for human rights abuses that have
   been committed by the North Korean government. A House Republican
   leadership aide told NBC News they are currently discussing the bill's
   future in the House.

   "We need to look for every way to deprive Pyongyang of income to build
   its weapons programs, strengthen its cyber capabilities, and abuse its
   own people," the bill's chief sponsor, Sen. Cory Gardner, a Republican
   from Colorado, said on the Senate floor, "We must also send a strong
   message to China, North Korea's diplomatic protector and largest
   trading partner, that the United States will use every economic tool at
   its disposal to stop Pyongyang."

   The passage of new sanctions in the Senate comes just days after North
   Korea launched a long-range rocket, drawing strong international
   condemnation.

   It also comes just over a month after North Korea claimed to test a
   [91]hydrogen bomb.

   On Tuesday, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told the
   Senate Armed Services Committee that [92]North Korea has restarted its
   efforts to produce weapons-grade nuclear material.

   "This legislation alone, though, will not cease North Korea's illegal
   activities," Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from California, said on
   the Senate floor, "However, it is a beginning of a more comprehensive
   response to North Korea's increasingly dangerous behavior."

   While the Senate has only held 20 votes this year, today's vote marks
   only the second vote Cruz has cast in 2016, and the third for Rubio.

   Both have missed a considerable number of votes while running for
   president, just as previous presidential candidates have in the past,
   but Rubio has come under particular criticism for missing 50 percent of
   the votes held since he announced his run for president in April of
   last year. Cruz has missed 33 percent of the votes since he announced
   his candidacy on March 23, 2015, and Sanders has missed 16.5 percent of
   the Senate votes cast since his announcement on March 26th of last
   year.

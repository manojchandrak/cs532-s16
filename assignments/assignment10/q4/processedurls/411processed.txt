   Nick Cokas, Katharine McPhee

   Jeffrey Mayer/WireImage

   [33]Katharine McPhee's six-year marriage to Nick Cokas is officially
   over.

   The Scorpion star filed for divorce from her husband in May 2014 after
   having already been separated for a year and now, close to two years
   later, a judge has signed off on their split agreement.

   According to court documents filed Monday in L.A. Superior Court,
   McPhee must pay Cokas $102,616 within the next few days, and he will
   thereafter receive spousal support of up to $400,000 a year, or a
   prorated $33,333 a month on a sliding scale.

   McPhee will get to keep all of the furniture, artwork and personal
   effects in her possession, including a 2013 Mercedes M Class SUV.
   Moreover, she'll hang onto various bank accounts and insurance
   policies, as well as certain music and TV rights.

   As for Cokas, he keeps his 2013 Jeep Wrangler and a percentage of some
   of his ex's music royalties.

   Years of Marriage

   At the time of the filing, the Scorpion star released the following
   diplomatic statement:

   "After six years of marriage, and having been separated for the past
   year, Katharine McPhee has filed for a dissolution of marriage from
   Nick Cokas. The two have an amicable relationship and will remain
   friends. They ask that people respect their privacy during this time."

   The pair had first met in 2005, a year before she rose to Hollywood
   prominence as a contestant on the fifth season of the famous Fox talent
   show.  Two years later, they got engaged and McPhee walked down the
   aisle in Beverly Hills on Feb. 2, 2008.

   Signs that their relationship had gone sour were quite clear when
   McPhee was [35]spotted kissing her also married Smash director Michael
   Morris in Oct. 2013, a period of time when the star claims she had
   already silently separated from her husband. Morris has since
   reconciled with his wife Mary McCormack, with whom he has three
   daughters.

   After McPhee and Cokas' separation, the singer was sighted getting
   [36]very close to her Scorpion co-star and new beau Elyes Gabel as
   early as January of last year, most recently enjoying a [37]beachside
   makeout session over the summer in between takes of their show.

   She filed for divorce on May 22, 2014, though their date of separation
   was later listed as May 24. McPhee "is in a really good place right
   now," a source told E! News at the time.

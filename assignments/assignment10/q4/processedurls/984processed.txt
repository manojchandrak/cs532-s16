   The Chronicle’s front page from Feb. 10, 1971, covers the Los Angeles
   earthquake.
   The Chronicle’s front page from Feb. 10, 1971, covers the Los...

   This was a big one.

   “A major earthquake rumbled through Southern California early
   yesterday, killing at least 35 persons, injuring hundreds and causing
   more than a billion dollars in damage to homes, businesses and roadways
   in Los Angeles and surrounding areas,” read a story on the front page
   of The Chronicle on Feb. 10, 1971.

   What became known as the Sylmar or San Fernando earthquake hit L.A.
   seconds after 6 a.m. with a magnitude of 6.6 in the foothills of the
   San Gabriel Mountains. Sixty-four were killed and more than 2,000
   injured, many in health care facility collapses.

   The photo on The Chronicle’s cover shows the destroyed San Fernando
   Veterans Administration Hospital, a group of structures built in 1925
   and about three miles from the quake’s epicenter. Forty-seven people
   died there.

   “The shock waves were so powerful that they knocked out the
   seismographic instruments at the California Institute of Technology in
   Pasadena,” the New York Times story reported.

   Luckily, when the quake hit many people were in bed and not on freeways
   or near buildings that were heavily damaged. But, “a sense of danger
   continued to hover over the city throughout the day.”

   Top O’ the Top of the News: “A militant Chinatown group accused police
   of harassment and threatened reprisal ‘by any means necessary.’ Page
   9.” Well, that’s certainly bold.

   Top O’ the Top of the News, Sporting Green edition: “The San Francisco
   Warriors will play tonight’s game against the Seattle Super Sonics at
   the Cow Palace. Page 51.” For an NBA fan, this sentence is awesome in
   so many ways.

   Chronicle newspaper page from our archive every day for 366 days.
   Library director Bill Van Niekerken, art director Danielle
   Mollette-Parks, producer Kimberly Chua and editorial assistant Jillian
   Sullivan contributed to the project. Tim O’Rourke is the executive

Why should athletes have to talk after a painful defeat?

By

   For an entire historic season Carolina quarterback Cam Newton spoke
   volumes, both with his play on the field and into the hundreds of media
   microphones that were placed in front of him.

   Newton is exuberant and outgoing, much like [247]Rickie Fowler, who has
   made his own competitive statements lately with four worldwide
   victories since last May.

   But on Super Sunday both opted for varying degrees of radio silence in
   the wake of essentially similar defeats.

   Sure, Newton’s loss in Super Bowl 50 will linger longer than Fowler’s
   playoff defeat at the Waste Management Phoenix Open, but at such
   heights pain born from athletic performance isn’t necessarily
   proportional.

   This reality of diminishing returns was evident in both star’s
   post-play press conferences on Sunday.

   Subdued and somber, Newton offered just 87 words to the media following
   the Panthers’ 24-10 loss to the Denver Broncos, with most no more than
   clipped, two-word responses.

   “Got outplayed,” Newton said moments before he bolted the interview
   area with a quick, “I'm done, man.”

   Following Fowler’s playoff loss to [249]Hideki Matsuyama at [250]TPC
   Scottsdale the game’s quintessential millennial wasn’t much more
   effusive, answering just four questions, for a total of 240 words,
   before offering a final emotional response followed by a quick exit.

   “I mean, the hard part is having, you know, all my friends and family
   and Grandpa and my dad who haven't seen me win. But I will be able to
   kind of hang with them tonight,” Fowler said as he fought back tears.
   “I’ll be all right. With how good I'm playing, I know I can win. That's
   the hard part.”

   Before you break the Internet debating how misguided are comparisons
   between Fowler, one of golf’s most likeable if not sometimes guarded
   players, and Newton, who can be as petulant as he is entertaining, the
   purpose of this correlation is only to acknowledge the emotions that
   accompany the enormity of such moments.

   “It’s going to hurt because I felt like I had it, especially with the
   way I was swinging,” said Fowler, who found the water twice on the 17th
   hole at TPC Scottsdale on Sunday.

   “That was a bit unfortunate. I hit it right on line, hit it exactly
   where I was looking [at No. 17]. That's kind of the unfortunate part to
   hit the shots that I did and to pull them off and then it kind of
   backfired.”

   To be clear, Newton was not nearly as talkative as Fowler in loss,
   particularly when asked the keys to Carolina’s defeat.

   “Got outplayed,” he mumbled.

   But the point is neither player was in much of a mood to talk, and it’s
   hard to blame them.

   It’s all part of the same DNA that makes athletes like Fowler and
   Newton so entertaining in victory, yet so difficult during emotional
   defeats.

   Some are able to compartmentalize loss better than others. When
   [251]Jordan Spieth’s birdie attempt at the 72nd hole at last year’s
   Open Championship rolled wide it cost the 22-year-old more than his
   name on the claret jug.

   Spieth had been vying to win the third leg of the single-season Grand
   Slam, and yet after he’d signed his scorecard and spoken with the media
   he joined the crowd behind the 18th green to watch [252]Zach Johnson
   win the playoff.

   Similarly, when [253]Brandt Snedeker struggled to a final-round 77 at
   the 2008 Masters after heading out in the day’s final group on Sunday
   he was just as overcome by emotion in his post-round Q&A with
   reporters, but showed an impressive amount of resilience answering 14
   questions.

   “You know, I have no clue why I am so emotional. I was laughing
   outside. I'm crying in here. I couldn't tell you. You know, it's just
   ...” Snedeker said through tears.

   They say players learn more from defeat than they do in victory and in
   golf the latter is a way of life with even the game’s best players
   coming up short more times than not. The same can be said of what can
   be learned about players in victory and defeat.

   While it’s easy to think the examples set by Spieth and Snedeker should
   be the standard, that entirely too simplistic logic ignores individual
   personalities.

   Fowler’s emotion is a measure of how much winning means to him, not a
   weakness to be corrected.

   A few days after his post-Super Bowl press conference, Newton summed it
   up best: “You show me a good loser and I'm going to show you a loser.”

Mass UberX protest by Montreal taxis sparks official calls to suspend app

Quebec transport minister, Montreal mayor call for halt to UberX operations

   Quebec Transport Minister Jacques Daoust and Montreal Mayor Denis
   Coderre are calling for the suspension of UberX while a government
   committee examines how taxis and the popular app-based ride service can
   co-exist in the province.

   The calls to suspend UberX come in the wake of a demonstration
   Wednesday that saw hundreds of taxis disrupt traffic at Montreal's
   Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport.

   protest. (Salimah Shivji/CBC)

   Daoust announced the plan to create a parliamentary committee on the
   issue last week in one of his first acts as Quebec's new transport
   minister.

   Those hearings are set to begin later this month.

   Daoust said Wednesday he considers the UberX app illegal, and believes
   the government needs to come up with a permanent solution that ensures
   a level playing field for taxi drivers.

   "What we see is that when you don't need a taxi permit, when you don't
   need an inspection, of course you'll be able to offer a good price," he
   said.

   The minister's call today for a suspension of UberX echoed a similar
   appeal by ​Coderre, who called for a truce while the committee conducts
   its inquiry.

   "This is very emotional, and I think we need to address this in a
   more serene way," the Montreal mayor said Wednesday.

   "We need a truce. I think that's the point we're at. We need a truce
   while the committee does its work and during this period UberX should
   cease its activities."

   Coderre [69]has also said he considers Uber illegal.

Mayor accused of defending 'monopoly interests'

   Uber said the calls for a suspension of its UberX service put the
   interests of the taxi industry ahead of the service's 350,000 customers
   and 8,000 drivers in Quebec.

     'It's the minister of transport and the premier that are punishing
     people, not us.' — Hassan Kattoua, taxi driver

   "It is unfortunate to see that once again Mayor Coderre [is] seeking to
   protect the monopoly interests of the taxi industry while overlooking
   the majority of Montrealers who have made clear their desire for safe,
   reliable and affordable transportation options," the company said.

   Protest organizers declared victory and ordered an end to the airport
   disruption.

   Benôit Jugand, spokesman for
   the Regroupement des travailleurs autonomes métallos (RTAM) said
   earlier in the day the protest was provoked by
   the province's failure to meet the group's "simple demand" to
   have Uber cease operations while a parliamentary committee looks into
   the matter.

   RTAM said 800 drivers and owners took part in the "blockade" of the
   airport.

   As the protest unfolded, traffic flow in the area where travellers
   board taxis was brought to a standstill, with hundreds of taxis lined
   up bumper to bumper.

   Montreal police had issued a release in advance of the
   protest, reminding taxi drivers that it is illegal to block access to
   airports.

   Protesters encountered a heavy police presence as they arrived at the
   airport.

Union claims Uber operates at airport

   At a news conference Wednesday morning, Jugand said the airport was
   being targeted because UberX drivers are still picking up clients there
   despite a $2.5-million exclusive contract between taxi owners and the
   airport.

   The airport authority issued a clarification of the claim on Wednesday,
   saying the Uber app does not work at the terminal, and that it is in
   talks with Uber and the city's taxi bureau to ensure UberX drivers
   aren't taking clients to and from the airport.

   "It's the minister of transport and the premier that are punishing
   people, not us. We've shown a lot of restraint for the past two years,"
   taxi driver Hassan Kattoua said.

   "In Montreal, you cannot sell chewing gum if you don't pay the GST and
   PST. How can a multi-billion-dollar company come and practise this tax
   evasion for the past two years and get unpunished. There's something
   weird going on."

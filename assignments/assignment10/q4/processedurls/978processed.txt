   An Israeli labour court on Wednesday ruled in favour of a former
   housekeeper at the Prime Minister Netanyahu residence who accused Sara
   Netanyahu of abuse and mistreatment.

   An Israeli court convicted Israeli Prime Minister [40]Binyamin
   Netanyahu's wife on Wednesday for abusing a former member of her
   housekeeping staff.

   The court found "an atmosphere of harmful work conditions at the
   [Netanyahu] residence due to the behavior of Mrs. Netanyahu and her
   attitude toward the workers".

   The judge wrote in her ruling that Sara Netanyahu engaged in
   "irrational demands, insults, humiliation and outbursts of rage".

   The Jerusalem labour court awarded the former employee, Meni Naftali,
   $42,000 in damages and court fees.

   The Netanyahus have been widely criticised in Israel for [41]leading a
   lavish lifestyle and Sara Netanyahu has faced accusations of abusive
   behavior toward household staff going back to the 1990s.

   At a press conference, Naftali thanked his supporters and said, "I am
   sure there will be more suits" against the prime minister's wife.

   Talking about Sara Netanyahu's behaviour, Naftali said in one instance
   she called him at 3am to complain that he had bought milk in a plastic
   storage bag instead of a carton.

   In another case, he says she threw a vase of day-old flowers on the
   floor, scolding him that they were not fresh enough.

   abusive language and forcing her to shower several times a day to
   ensure a "sterile" environment. [rightQuots.png]

   Naftali has also claimed that Sara Netanyahu derided his ethnicity when
   he ordered food for them in a hotel, implying that his Middle Eastern
   background was somehow uncouth.

   Netanyahu's office had no immediate comment. It had previously rejected
   Naftali's allegations, calling them "outrageous".

   Sara Netanyahu has attracted criticism since her husband's first term
   as prime minister in the late 1990s for allegedly squabbling with her
   staff and meddling in state affairs.

   Among other things, she was accused of firing a nanny for burning a pot
   of soup and of throwing a pair of shoes at an assistant.

   Since her husband returned to office in 2009, she has kept a lower
   profile, though she has been unable to avoid the spotlight entirely.

   In 2010, a former housekeeper accused her of using abusive language and
   forcing her to shower several times a day to ensure a "sterile"
   environment.
   Last week, former Israeli [42]Prime Minister Ehud Olmert admitted to
   obstructing justice in a series of graft-linked trials.

   Olmert [43]faces an 18-month jail sentence beginning on February 15
   after being convicted of bribery, in addition to separate jail time for
   corruption and fraud.

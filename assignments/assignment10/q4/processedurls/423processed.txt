   REUTERS: Professional caddies were scheduled to meet at Pebble Beach on
   Wednesday night and discuss whether to continue fighting the PGA Tour
   after losing a class action lawsuit contending they were forced to wear
   bibs featuring corporate logos that made them 'human billboards'.

   One caddie told Reuters he had lost the stomach to appeal the ruling,
   while the president of the caddies' association told Golf Channel he
   was ready to put the matter behind him.

   The lawsuit, filed just over a year ago in U.S. federal court in
   California, said the PGA Tour threatened to prevent the caddies from
   working at tournaments organised and promoted by the organisation if
   they refused to wear the bibs.

   The lawsuit also claimed that the PGA Tour reaps more than US$50
   million annually from the endorsements, but the caddies receive no
   compensation.

   However United States District Judge Vince Chhabria on Tuesday
   dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice, saying: "The caddies' overall
   complaint about poor treatment by the Tour has merit, but this federal
   lawsuit about bibs does not."

   The caddies, who were seeking a permanent injunction against the
   practice of wearing bibs, help their players select clubs and read the
   greens during tournaments.

   Mike Hicks, the lead plaintiff, has been a caddie for nearly 35 years
   and has worked for leading golfers such as Greg Norman, Payne Stewart,
   Steve Stricker and Justin Leonard.

   The lawsuit, filed on behalf of 168 caddies in the U.S. who wear or
   have worn bibs with the logos of the PGA Tour's sponsors, claimed the
   Tour interfered with the caddies' ability to compete in the market,
   alleged antitrust violations, breach of contract and violations of
   California state law.

   Now that the judge has dismissed the lawsuit, each of the 168 caddies
   must decide individually whether to appeal.

   The caddies had a previously-scheduled meeting planned at the PGA Tour
   stop in Pebble Beach, California on Wednesday. The lawsuit ruling
   immediately went to the top of the unofficial agenda.

   "To be honest, I don't think I really want to continue," said one
   caddie, who asked not to be named. "The system has spoken."

   He added that the lawsuit had been mentally draining and that he wanted
   to get back to focusing on his job.

   James Edmondson, president of the Association of Professional Tour
   Caddies, sounded a similar theme.

   "I respect the court's decision and do not plan to go any further with
   it," he told GolfChannel.com.

   The PGA Tour said in a statement that they were "pleased by the court's
   decision" in their favour.

   "We look forward to putting this matter behind us and moving forward in
   a positive direction with the caddies."

   In his ruling, judge Chhabria said: "Caddies have been required to wear
   the bibs for decades. So caddies know, when they enter the profession,
   that wearing a bib during tournaments is part of the job. In other
   words, the bib is the primary part of a caddie's uniform."

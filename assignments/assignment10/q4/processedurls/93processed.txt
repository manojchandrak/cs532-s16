   The U-13 Girls Ontario Indoor Cup, between AG London and Scarborough
   Wexford, saw both sides feeling each out for much of the first half,
   without taking too many risks, before a wild finish to the second
   half.

   AG London’s Aelwyn Nash and Scarborough’s Sara Odza each made numerous
   saves to ensure the score remained locked at 0-0 through the first 10
   minutes.

   Scarborough was the first to break through when a free kick played into
   the box found the foot of Montana Wilcox. Wilcox controlled the ball,
   spun towards the net and buried her chance to give Wexford a 1-0 lead.

   Nia Wilson would make it 2-0 for Scarborough just before half when she
   turned her defender and found herself alone in on net, converting her
   chance.

   London had multiple chances throughout the second half but Odza would
   turn them away time again.

   It wasn’t until 7 minutes remaining London would finally find a way
   through and it took a special effort from Ella Vande Sompel. Starting
   the play in her half, the ball bounced off a few defenders before it
   finally settled from about 15 yards out. Vande Sompel’s shot, low and
   hard, beat the keeper and inspired her team.

   Minutes later London’s Jillian Hogewoning would tie the game at 2-2
   with a great individual effort. Hailey Burk, less than a minute later,
   would complete the comeback for London as she put her team ahead 3-2,
   with three minutes to go.

   Scarborough would press to equalize but London would lock it down the
   rest of the way, crowning London the U-13 Girls Ontario Indoor Cup
   champions.

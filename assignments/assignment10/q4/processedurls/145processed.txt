Twitter Hit By Falling Monthly Usage Numbers

   Website hails "strong year" in 2015 as revenues surge but shares
   initially dip 14% on disappointment over users and outlook.

   Twitter shares have been hit by volatile after-hours trading after its
   latest results showed a decline in monthly active usage in the last
   quarter.

   Revenues for the whole of 2015 were up 58% to $2.2bn (£1.5bn)
   representing what the company called "another very strong year for
   Twitter".

   But investors were instead focused on the number of active users of the
   site. The total number of these was flat compared to the previous
   quarter but according to Twitter's own preferred underlying measure it
   fell.

   Shares slumped by as much as 14% before recovering the losses to leave
   the price flat.

   It follows a catastrophic three months in which the company has lost
   half its value. Twitter has been making changes to the way it works but
   is [34]lagging behind market leader Facebook on a number of fronts
   including earnings and user numbers.

   In its latest results the company said: "We saw a decline in monthly
   active usage in Q4, but we've already seen January monthly actives
   bounce back to Q3 levels. We're confident that, with disciplined
   execution, this growth trend will continue over time."

   :: [35]Analysis: Should Twitter Worry About User Numbers?

   Total monthly active users (MAUs) were 320 million for the quarter,
   lower than expected and unchanged from the previous period. It was the
   first flat quarter-on-quarter performance since the company floated on
   the stock market in 2013.

   But stripping out SMS fast followers - people who sign up and access
   Twitter entirely using text messages - the figure was 305 million, down
   from 307 million in the third quarter. These SMS users are seen as hard
   to make money from.

   Twitter also disappointed traders with its revenue expectations for the
   current first quarter - at $595m-$610m (£410m-£420m) these were well
   below Wall Street forecasts.

   The micro-blogging site saw revenues of $710m (£489m) in the three
   months to the end of December, up 48% from the same period last year
   thanks to a surge in advertising turnover.

   Twitter habitually makes losses and it was in the red by $90m (£62m) in
   the fourth quarter, though this was 28% down year-on-year. For the full
   year, losses narrowed by 10% to $521m (£359m).

   The results came hours after Twitter announced a [36]major change on
   Wednesday, saying it would now show the best
   algorithimically-selected tweets at the top of users' timelines.

   At the moment, most people see a constant stream of updates in reverse
   chronological order.

   The weak results are likely to stoke investor concerns over stalled
   growth, which a series of initiatives since the return of founder Jack
   Dorsey last summer have failed to reverse.

   Brian Blau, research director at Gartner, said: "With no increase in
   new users, but otherwise good financial performance, Twitter hasn't yet
   shown how it can rise from the troubling spot of not being able to grow
   the business."

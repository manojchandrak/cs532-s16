   Nigeria, on 2 February, 2016

   Two female suicide bombers blew themselves up in a northeast Nigerian
   refugee camp, killing at least 56 people.

   Some reports say more than 60 people have been killed.

   Health and rescue officials say a further 78 people are being treated
   for wounds in the camp, which houses around 50,000 refugees.

   The attack reportedly took place on Tuesday, but a breakdown in the
   telephone system prevented the information from being made public
   earlier.

   Officials blamed Boko Haram for the bombings at Dikwa, 55 miles
   northeast of Maiduguri, the biggest city in the region - and birthplace
   of Boko Haram.

   Boko Haram's six-year insurgency has killed around 20,000 people and
   made around 2.5 million homeless.

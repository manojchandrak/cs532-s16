Johnny Depp stars in Donald Trump spoof film

   'New York should be a place where everyone, no matter their race,
   religion, creed, colour, can be priced out of their own
   neighborhood,' says fake Trump

   Johnny Depp is known as a versatile character actor, and has played a
   pirate, a mad hatter and a knife-wielding barber. For his latest role,
   he has adopted a blonde comb-over and a distinctly recognisable Queens
   accent.

   The new spoof film of Donald Trump, based on his book “Trump: The Art
   of The Deal”, has begun streaming on the website [143]Funny Or Die,
   with an all-star cast including Mr Depp, Jack McBrayer, Patton
   Oswald, Alfred Molina, Michaela Watkins as Ivana Tramp and Stephen
   Merchant. It is set in 1980s New York, when the business mogul was
   breaking hearts, making deals and zooming around New York on his
   helicopter.

   Timing of the 50-minute film has been impeccable - the Republican won
   the New Hampshire Primary on Tuesday night alongside Democrat Bernie
   Sanders. The real Mr Trump had swaggered onto the stage - “wow, wow,
   wow - so beautiful” - quickly regaining his confidence after losing out
   in the Iowa caucus last week.

Donald Trump swaggers his way to victory in New Hampshire

   Director Ron Howard said at the start of the feature that Mr Trump
   supposedly had “vowed never to air his masterpiece” because its showing
   in the 1980s was preempted by a Monday night football game.

   Mr Howard joked that the video disappeared for decades, until last
   summer he wrestled the video tape from a “woman named Ginny”.

   The film, which had been kept secret for months, covers Mr Trump’s
   desperate quest to buy the Taj Mahal Casino from the Hilton family and
   makes fun of several of the book’s chapters like "The Art of
   Intimidating Rent-Controlled Tenants" and "The Art of Defeating Totally
   Bogus Lawsuits".

   “I love minorities, they are exotic, they are sensual, especially the
   Asians,” Mr Depp said in the film to former New York mayor Ed Koch,
   played by Harry Winkler.

   “New York should be a place where everyone, no matter their race,
   religion, creed, colour, can be priced out of their own neighborhood,”
   he said.

   “Trump: The Art of the Deal” was first published in 1987 as a part
   memoir and part business tip book. It was a New York Times bestseller
   for months.

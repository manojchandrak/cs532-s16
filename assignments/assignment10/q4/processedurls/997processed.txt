   [56]OU President David Boren's proposed pay cuts would save almost
   $250,000 Andrew Clark, assistant news managing editor The Oklahoma

       OU President David Boren has proposed cutting the pay of many deans
       and vice presidents of the university as part of a money-saving
       initiative amid a statewide budget crisis.
       Boren has proposed to cut his own pay and that of 26 other OU vice
       presidents and deans by 3 percent to save almost $250,000, OU press
       secretary Corbin Wallace said. The proposed cuts would take place
       July 1.
       The money saved will go toward need-based scholarships for
       students, he said.
       Not all deans and vice presidents will have their pay cut, however.
       Wallace said any dean or vice president who makes less than
       $200,000 will not receive a cut, including Scott Mason, the vice
       president of governmental relations; Matthew Hamilton, the vice
       president of enrollment; and Nicole Judice Campbell, the dean of
       University College.
       The salary reductions are part of Boren’s plan to cut the
       university’s budget by $20 million amid a statewide budget
       shortfall. Other administrators affected by the pay cuts include
       Kyle Harper, the executive vice president and provost; Clarke
       Stroud, the vice president for Student Affairs; and Jabar Shumate,
       the vice president for the University Community.
       Ed Kelley, the interim dean of the Gaylord College of Journalism
       and Mass Communication, who is also facing a 3 percent pay cut,
       said there had been plenty of informal discussion regarding the
       cuts prior to their announcement.
       “I picked up on some of it last week, and my guess is that this has
       been discussed since ... the middle of January right before the
       semester began,” he said.
       Kelley also said he believes the pay cut is to show that the people
       atop the university’s hierarchy are unified in moving to eliminate
       the budget deficit.
       “I think (Boren) wanted to make sure that everybody here, at a time
       when it is very unlikely for there to be pay raises … that the
       people here who were doing well salary-wise, that they were
       contributing to what was going on,” Kelley said.
       OU’s administrative costs are among the lowest in the nation and
       have been cut in half, down to 4.5 percent, since 1994, Boren said
       in a press release.
       Boren has also unveiled other initiatives to cut the university’s
       budget, including a voluntary early retirement plan, reductions in
       purchases and travel and a reduction of faculty and staff by
       attrition.
       Those eligible for Boren’s voluntary early retirement plan will be
       notified of their eligibility Feb. 15.
       The cutting of OU’s budget stems from the state playing less and
       less of a role in funding it. State appropriations comprise 15.5
       percent of OU’s total operating revenue budget for the fiscal year
       2016, while they comprised 31.3 percent of the university's total
       operating revenue budget in the fiscal year 1995.
       However, the total amount of money state appropriations contribute
       to the budget has increased by about 11.56 percent since 1995 when
       adjusted for inflation.
       Kelley said the challenges the state is facing may be the toughest
       it has faced since the 1980s, when low oil prices caused an
       economic crisis in the state.

																										<p>When Danielle Fraser first submitted her paper for publication, she had little idea of the painful saga that lay ahead.</p>																				<p>She had spent some 18 months studying thousands of fossil species spread across North America from the past 36 million years, and now she had an intriguing result: animal populations were spread widest across latitudes in warm, wet climates. Her work, crucial to earning her PhD at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, might be used to make predictions about the response of mammals to climate change — a key question in ecology today. So, with her PhD adviser's encouragement, she sent it to <i>Science</i> in October 2012.</p>

	</div>

																										<p>Ten days later, the paper was rejected with a form letter. She sent it to another prestigious journal, the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>. Rejected. Next, she tried <i>Ecology Letters</i>. Bounced. “At this point, I definitely was frustrated. I hadn't even been reviewed and I would've loved to know how to improve the paper,” recalls Fraser. “I thought, 'Let's just get it out and go to a journal that will assess the paper'.”</p>																				<p>In May 2013, she submitted the paper to <i>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</i>, considered a high-impact journal in her field. The journal sent it out for review — seven months after her initial submission to <i>Science</i>. “Finally!” Fraser thought. What she didn't know was that she had taken only the first steps down the long, bumpy road to publication: it would take another three submissions, two rejections, two rounds of major revisions and numerous drafts before the paper would finally appear. By that point, she could hardly bear to look at it.</p>																				<p>Fraser's frustration is widely shared: researchers are increasingly questioning the time it takes to publish their work. Many say that they feel trapped in a cycle of submission, rejection, review, re-review and re-re-review that seems to eat up months of their lives, interfere with job, grant and tenure applications and slow down the dissemination of results. In 2012, Leslie Vosshall, a neuroscientist at the Rockefeller University in New York City, wrote a commentary that lamented the “glacial pace” of scientific publishing<sup><a href="#b1">1</a></sup>. “In the past three years, if anything, it's gotten substantially worse,” she says now. “It takes forever to get the work out, regardless of the journal. It just takes far too long.”</p>

	</div>

																										<p>But is the publication process actually becoming longer — and, if so, then why? To find out, <i>Nature</i> examined some recent analyses on time to publication — many of them performed by researchers waiting for their own work to see the light of day — and spoke to scientists and editors about their experiences.</p>																				<p>The results contain some surprises. Daniel Himmelstein, a computational-biology graduate student at the University of California, San Francisco, <a href="http://blog.dhimmel.com/history-of-delays">analysed all the papers indexed in the PubMed database that had listed submission and acceptance dates</a>. His study, done for <i>Nature</i>, found no evidence for lengthening delays<sup><a href="#b2">2</a></sup>: the median review time — the time between submission and acceptance of a paper — has hovered at around 100 days for more than 30 years (see <a href="#paper">'Paper wait'</a>). But the analysis comes with major caveats. Not all journals — including some high-profile ones — deposit such time-stamp data in PubMed, and some journals show when a paper was resubmitted, rather than submitted for the first time. “Resetting the clock is an especially pernicious issue,” Himmelstein says, and it means that the analysis might be underestimating publication delays.</p>

	</div>

																										<p>Some data suggest that wait times have increased within certain subsets of journals, such as popular open-access ones and some of the most sought-after titles. At <i>Nature</i>, the median review time has grown from 85 days to just above 150 days over the past decade, according to Himmelstein's analysis, and at <i>PLoS ONE</i> it has risen from 37 to 125 days over roughly the same period.</p>																											<div class="html-widget img-left"><iframe src="http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/2579065/Longest-time-that-you-have-waited-for-a-research-paper-to-be-published" frameborder="0" width="400
" height="475" style="overflow:hidden; border: 1px solid #c8c7cf; border-radius: 5px;"></iframe>
</div>																										<p>Many scientists find this odd, because they expect advances in digital publishing and the proliferation of journals to have sped things up. They say that journals are taking too long to review papers and that reviewers are requesting more data, revisions and new experiments than they used to. “We are demanding more and more unreasonable things from each other,” says Vosshall. Journal editors counter that science itself has become more data-rich, that they work to uphold high editorial and peer-review standards and that some are dealing with increasing numbers of papers. They also say that they are taking steps to expedite the process.</p>

	</div>

																										<p>Publication practices and waiting times also vary widely by discipline — with social sciences being notoriously slow. In physics, the pressure to publish fast is reduced because of the common practice of publishing preprints — early versions of a paper before peer review — <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/the-arxiv-preprint-server-hits-1-million-articles-1.16643">on the arXiv server</a>. Some of the loudest complaints about publication delays come from those in biological fields, in which competition is fierce and publishing in prestigious journals can be required for career advancement. This month, a group of more than 70 scientists, funders, journal editors and publishers are meeting at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute campus in Chevy Chase, Maryland, to discuss whether biologists should adopt the <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/preprints-come-to-life-1.14140">preprint model to accelerate publishing</a>. “We need a fundamental rethinking of <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v495/n7442/full/495437a.html">how we do this</a>,” Vosshall says.<a name="paper"></a></p>

	</div>

																										<h2>The pitch</h2>																				<p>In March 2012, Stephen Royle, a cell biologist at the University of Warwick, UK, started on a publication mission of his own. His latest work answered a controversial question about how cells sense that chromosomes are lined up before dividing, so he first sent it to <i>Nature Cell Biology</i> (<i>NCB</i>), because it is a top journal in his field and an editor there had suggested he send it after hearing Royle give a talk. It was rejected without review. Next, he sent it to <i>Developmental Cell</i>. Rejected. His next stop, the <i>Journal of Cell Biology</i>, sent the paper out for review. It came back with a long list of necessary revisions — and a rejection.</p>																				<p>Royle and his lab spent almost six months doing the suggested experiments and revising the paper. Then he submitted the updated manuscript to <i>Current Biology</i>. Rejected. <i>EMBO Journal</i>. Reviewed and rejected.</p>																				<p>Finally, in December 2012, he submitted it to the <i>Journal of Cell Science</i> (<i>JCS</i>), where it was reviewed. One reviewer mentioned that they had already assessed it at another journal and thought that it should have been published then. They wrote that the work was “beautifully conducted, well controlled, and conservatively interpreted”. A second reviewer said that it should not be published. The editor at <i>JCS</i> decided to accept it. The time between first submission to <i>Nature Cell Biology</i> and acceptance at <i>JCS</i> was 317 days. It appeared online another 53 days later<sup><a href="#b3">3</a></sup>. The work went on to win the <i>JCS</i> prize as the journal's top paper for 2013.</p>																											<div class="html-widget img-left"><iframe src="http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/2579002/The-best-way-to-shorten-the-time-taken-to-publish-a-paper" frameborder="0" width="625
" height="440" style="overflow:hidden; border: 1px solid #c8c7cf; border-radius: 5px;"></iframe>
</div>																										<p>Despite the accolade, Royle says that the multiple rejections were demoralizing for his student, who had done the experiments and needed the paper to graduate. He also thinks that the paper deserved the greater exposure that comes from publication in a more prestigious journal. “Unfortunately, the climate at the moment is that if papers aren't in those very top journals, they get overlooked easily,” he says. And Royle, who has done several publication-time analyses and blogged about what he found, has shown that this experience is not unusual. When he looked at the 28 papers that his lab had published in the previous 12 years, the average time to gestate from first submission to publication was the same as a human baby — about 9 months (see <a href="http://go.nature.com/79h2n3">go.nature.com/79h2n3</a>).</p>																											








			




	<div class="img img-right" style="width:152px"> 		<div class="img-content cleared" style="padding:1px">

	</div>

																										<p>But how much of these delays were his own doing? To publish the chromosome paper, Royle indulged in the all-too-familiar practice of journal shopping: submitting first to the <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/science-publishing-the-golden-club-1.13951">most prestigious journals</a> in his field (often those with the highest impact factor) and then working his way <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/rate-that-journal-1.17225">down the hierarchy</a>. (<i>Nature Cell Biology</i>'s current impact factor is 19; <i>JCS</i>'s is 5.) Journal impact factor or reputation are widely used by scientists and grant-review and hiring committees as a proxy for the quality of the paper. On the flip side, critics say that editors seek out the splashiest papers to boost their publication's impact factor, something that encourages journal shopping, increases rejection rates and adds to the wait time. Journal editors reject this; Ritu Dhand, Nature editorial director in London, says that <i>Nature</i>'s policy of selecting original, important work “may lead to citation impact and media coverage, but <i>Nature</i> editors aren't driven by those considerations”.</p>																				<p>How much time does journal shopping add? In the analysis of his group's research papers, Royle found that more than half were shopped around, and that this consumed anywhere from a few days to more than eight months. He went on to analyse all the papers published in 2013 that are indexed in PubMed, and examined whether higher impact factor correlated with longer median publication times. He found an inverted bell-shaped curve — the journals with the lowest and highest impact factors had longer review times than did those in the middle. For the vast majority of those in the middle, review times stood at around 100 days — matching Himmelstein's analysis. Those with the very highest impact factors (30–50) had a review time of 150 days, supporting the idea that pitching a paper to a series of top journals could result in significant delays in publication.</p>

	</div>

																										<p>Many scientists, editors and publishers have long acknowledged that journal name is a flawed measure of the quality and value of a piece of research — but the problem shows <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/how-to-judge-scientists-strengths-1.18769">no signs of going away</a>. “Where your paper is published doesn't say anything about you, your paper's impact or whether it's right or wrong,” says Maria Leptin, director of EMBO, an organization of Europe's leading life scientists and publisher of the <i>EMBO Journal</i>. “Nobody has the courage to say, we, as a funding organization, or we, as a tenure committee, are not going to look at <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/how-to-judge-scientists-strengths-1.18769">where you publish as opposed to what you publish</a>.”</p>																				<p>And the obsession with prestigious journals is just one source of delay — as Fraser, who was battling to publish her paper on ancient animal populations — was about to found out.</p>																				<h2>Peer review</h2>																				<p>By October 2013, a full year had passed since Fraser had first submitted her paper to a journal, and she had pretty much stopped caring about impact factor. By this point, the paper had spent two months in review at <i>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</i>, before coming back with mixed reports — and a rejection. So Fraser decided to try <i>PLoS ONE</i>, a journal that says it will publish any rigorous science, regardless of its significance, scope or anticipated citations.

																										<p><i>PLoS ONE</i> sent the paper out to a single reviewer. Two months later, Fraser got a decision letter that essentially stated that the paper was rejected but might be eligible for re-review if the suggested revisions were made. She made the revisions, adding citations and a small amount of reanalysis. In March 2014, she resubmitted the manuscript, which <i>PLoS ONE</i> sent out to a different reviewer. Another two months passed before she received the new review: major revisions, please.</p>																				<p>“I'm just happy they didn't tell me to go away,” recalls Fraser. “I do have e-mails from the time that say, '1-millionth draft'!” She persevered, making more revisions to meet the reviewer's demands, and in June 2014 submitted the paper to <i>PLoS ONE</i> for a third time. Success! The paper<sup><a href="#b4">4</a></sup> was published online 23 months after she had first sent it to <i>Science</i>. The long peer-review and revision process did improve the paper, Fraser says now. “It was really much better.” But did the main conclusion of the paper change? “Not really.”</p>

																										<p>Last year, Chris Hartgerink, a behavioural-sciences graduate student at Tilburg University in the Netherlands, ran an analysis of the Public Library of Science (PLOS) family of journals since the first one launched in 2003. (He chose the journals largely because they make the data easily accessible, and because he was waiting for a paper to be published in <i>PLoS ONE</i>.) He found that the mean review time had roughly doubled in the past decade, from 50–130 days to 150–250 days, depending on the journal (see <a href="http://go.nature.com/s3voeq">go.nature.com/s3voeq</a>). And when Royle looked at eight journals that had published cell-biology papers over the past decade, he found that publication times had lengthened at seven of them, mostly because review times had stretched out.</p>

																										<p>One contention is that peer reviewers now ask for more. When Ron Vale, a cell biologist at the University of California, San Francisco, analysed biology papers that had been published in <i>Cell</i>, <i>Nature</i> and the <i>Journal of Cell Biology</i>, in the first six months of 1984 and compared that with the same period in 2014, he found that both the average number of authors and the number of panels in experimental figures rose by 2–4 fold<sup><a href="#b5">5</a></sup>. This showed, he argued, that the amount of data required for a publication had gone up, and Vale suspects that much of the added data come from authors trying to meet reviewers' demands. Scientists grumble about overzealous critics who always seem to want more, or different, experiments to nail a point. “It's very rare for the revisions to fundamentally change a paper — the headline doesn't change,” Royle says. His analysis of his group's publication times showed that almost 4 months of the average 9-month gestation was spent revising papers for resubmission.</p>																				<p>Many scientists also blame journal editors, who, they say, can be reluctant to provide clear guidance and decisions to authors when reviews are mixed — unnecessarily stringing out the review and revision process. Journal heads disagree, and say that their editors are accomplished at handling mixed reviews. <i>Cell</i> editor-in-chief Emilie Marcus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, says that editors at her journal take responsibility for publication decisions and help authors to map out a plan for revisions.</p>																				<p>Technological advances mean that research now involves handling more and more data, editors say, and there is greater emphasis on making that information available to the community. Marcus says that her journal is working to cut review times by, for example, increasing the number of papers that go through only one round of revision — 14% of their papers did so in 2015. In 2009, <i>Cell</i> also restricted the amount of supplemental material that could accompany papers as a way to keep requests for “additional, unrelated experiments” at bay.</p>

																										<p>PLOS executive editor Veronique Kiermer, based in San Francisco, declined to discuss the specifics of Fraser's paper, but she called its total review time of nine months an “outlier” and said that it was “not ideal to have research being evaluated by a single person”. She acknowledges that <i>PLoS ONE</i>'s publication time has risen; one factor is that the volume of papers has, too — from 200 in 2006 to 30,000 per year now — and it takes time to find and assign appropriate editors and reviewers. (PLOS used 76,000 reviewers in 2015.) Another, says Kiermer, is that the number of essential checkpoints — including competing-interest disclosures, animal-welfare reports and screens for plagiarism — have increased in the past decade. “We'll do everything we can both in terms of technology and looking at workflows to bring these times to publication down,” she says.</p>																				<p>Dhand says that at <i>Nature</i>, too, editors find it harder to find reviewers than in the past, “presumably because there are so many more papers that need reviewing”. Himmelstein found that the number of papers in PubMed more than doubled between 2000 and 2015, reaching nearly 1 million articles.</p>																				<h2>Technology advances</h2>																				<p>Digital publishing may have had benefits in shortening 'production' time — the time from acceptance to publication — rather than time in review. In Himmelstein's analysis, time spent in production has halved since the early 2000s, falling to a stable median of 25 days.</p>																				<p>Several new journals and online publishing platforms have promised to speed up the process even more. PeerJ, a family of journals that launched in 2013, is one of several that now encourage open peer review, in which reviewers' names and comments are posted alongside articles. The hope is that the transparency will prevent unnecessary delays or burdensome revision requests from reviewers.</p>

																										<p>The biomedical and life-sciences journal <i>eLife</i> launched in 2012 with a pledge to make initial editorial decisions within a few days and to review papers quickly. Reviewers get strict instructions not to suggest the 'perfect experiment', and they can ask for extra analysis only if it can be completed within 2 months. Otherwise, the paper is rejected. Randy Schekman, a cell biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and editor-in-chief of <i>eLife</i>, says that these policies mean that more than two-thirds of the journal's accepted papers undergo just one round of review.</p>																				<p>In a 2015 analysis, Himmelstein created a ranking by the <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/long-wait-for-publication-plagues-many-journals-1.17901">median review time</a> for all 3,482 journals that had papers with time stamps in the PubMed database from January 2014 to June 2015 (see <a href="http://go.nature.com/sscrr6">go.nature.com/sscrr6</a>). <i>PeerJ</i> had a relatively fast time: 74 days after submission. At <i>eLife</i>, it took 108 days, and <i>PLoS ONE</i> took 117. By comparison, <i>Cell</i>'s review time was 127 days; <i>Nature</i>'s was 173 days; <i>PLoS Medicine</i> took 177 days; and <i>Developmental Cell</i> was among the slowest of the popular biomedical journals, at 194 days. Marcus notes that comparison between journals is difficult because the publications define received, revised and accepted days differently, and that <i>Developmental Cell</i> places a high priority on timely review.</p>																				<h2>Preprints reconsidered</h2>

																										<p>One way for biologists to accelerate publication is by embracing preprints. These allow work to quickly receive credit and critique, says Bruno Eckhardt, associate editor of <i>Physical Review E</i> and a theoretical physicist at the University of Marburg in Germany. “It is almost like going on Facebook — it means you are ready to go public,” he says. A preprint submitted to bioRxiv — a server run by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York — is published online within 24 hours and given a digital object identifier (DOI); subsequent revisions are time-stamped and anyone can read and comment on the paper. “The minute a research story gets into the public domain, it benefits from the collective power of different brains looking at a problem,” says Vale. What's more, proponents say, preprint publishing can simply be added onto the conventional publication process. <i>F1000Research</i>, which launched in 2012, does this by publishing papers first, then inviting open peer review and revision.</p>																				<p>Some scientists are going a step further, and using platforms such as GitHub, Zenodo and figshare to publish each hypothesis, data collection or figure as they go along. Each file can be given a DOI, so that it is citable and trackable. Himmelstein, who already publishes his papers as preprints, has been using the Thinklab platform to progressively write up and publish the results of a new project since January 2015. “I push 'publish' and it gets a DOI with no delay,” he says. “Am I really gaining that much by publishing [in a conventional journal]? Or is it better to do what is fastest and most efficient to get your research out there?”</p>																				<p>But preprints and real-time digital publishing platforms are no panacea. Vosshall says that many biologists are “terrified” of preprints because they fear getting scooped by competitors or losing credit and intellectual-property rights for their ideas. And even after preprint publishing, scientists can still find themselves slogging through peer review and chasing high-impact journals for a final publication to adorn their CV. Vosshall says that the scientific community relies on conventional journals to serve as a 'prestige filter' so that important papers are brought to the attention of the right readers. Without them, “How do we find the good stuff?” she asks.</p>

																										<p>For Fraser, her <i>PLoS ONE</i> publication proved a success. When the paper was finally published after its almost-two-year wait, she got positive responses, she says. It has been viewed nearly 2,000 times, had 51 shares on Facebook and Twitter and got 280 downloads. The publication also helped her to secure her current position — as a postdoctoral fellow at the Smithsonian Institution Museum of Natural History in Washington DC. “I pretty much got the top postdoc that I could have gotten.”</p>																				<p>Still, the whole process is not something she wants to endure again — so these days, she tends to send her papers to mid-range journals that are likely to publish her work right away. “If my ultimate goal is to get a faculty job, I can't afford to wait two years on a single paper,” she says.</p>

							<dd>Clique Publishers to opt new accepting methods.

 Publishing research became arduous for its longer acceptance process time, frustrate in formatting for re-submissions and all this is done without any sustainable cause. Many travail works could not see light due to submission, rejection, review and re-review cycle. Nature Journal could not ameliorate beyond 3% in acceptance compared to its submissions increase of 30% in last 16 years. Today the manuscript publishing system is egotistical towards editor and many researchers reached ambivalence and complaisant.   To create a researcher centric publishing system, we suggest that a publishing clique need to maintain a depository of manuscripts and make them available to other editorial teams without names and affiliations. Accepting from such depository shortens the 'Publishing Wait' and 'search for interdisciplinary journals'. Manuscripts not attracted for a specific period can be deleted or kept open for
improvement from other peers.

							<dd>I took the poll, and selected "not shopping around", but in reality the right answer should be "all of the above". Particularly important are two issues, though: (1) making your work accessible to the world (and citable) by posting a preprint simultaneously with the first submission and (2) advisers should teach their junior colleagues that part of their qualifications as a scientist is to estimate realistically the level of their own work. The right question to ask is not "Do I have a slim chance to have this accepted in Nature?" but "If I were to referee for Nature the same paper authored by my competitors, what would be my verdict?"</dd>

							<dd>Science Papers Rejected, Reviewed, Re-reviewed, And ....
 
Here is a brief account of my experience on the subject. In 1980, JAMA published a paper in which my co-investigators and I reported our autopsy findings of coexistence of bone marrow iron depletion with hepatosplenic siderosis in hemodialysis patients who had received intravenous iron-dextran infusions (ref. 1). The journal editorialized our paper. In a follow-up paper, we revealed the failure of serum ferritin concentrations to predict bone narrow reserves. This paper was rejected by eleven journals in the U.S. 

Then one of my colleagues, Professor Alfred Fayemi, suggested that we submit the paper to some journal in New Zealand. Puzzled by the suggestion, I asked why that country. “Because no one there knows us.” We laughed at the idea. Then we submitted it to Lancet and were pleasantly surprised by the acceptance letter (ref.2).

We speculated that there might be an American reviewers club. Once a member of this club rejects a paper, every other member is honor-bound to do the same. Our experience with eleven American rejections seemed to support that. We sent the next paper about iron transport and distribution to Archives of Pathology and laboratory Medicine (an American journal) which the journal accepted (ref.3) Where does that leave us? We still wonder.

							<dd>As this article notes, about half of all papers submitted go through the process of "journal shopping". In the end, this expends additional time on the part of reviewers, and just slows down the review process. In a sense, scientists are hurting themselves, as far as a seeking quick turn around on their papers.

One way to minimize "journal shopping" is to make tenure committees greater stake-holders in the science than the place of
publication, e.g., minimize CNS (Cell, Nature, Science) counting by biology departments. This is not impossible. I am in two departments, each with distinct policies toward tenure. Only one requires that at least the head of the tenure committee must read the key papers from the tenure file and present a short seminar on the nature and impact of the candidates work to the
department at large. You can guess which department cares less about the impact factor of the journals of record as compared to the perceived quality and projected impact of the papers.

Just a thought.</dd>

							<dd>I read this article with great interest.  I am now long past my undergraduate work in biology and have, after earning an MFA in Theatre Design, had a long and successful career in both the professional and academic theatre (I know, right?).  For us, publication is called opening night.  Occasionally, one of us will invent something or publish some history or literature-based research in major academic publications but, for the most part, the arts community is unaware of your struggles in the sciences and, I have to say, this blissful ignorance is regrettable.  

Recently, the Siren's song of my favorite science has called to me as I pondered the issue of how audiences perceive our productions.  This led me into the fascinating world of the neurobiology of perception and evolutionary biology where I immediately found a new passion.  I have a lot to catch up on but one day I hope to publish a unique perspective on this topic that synthesizes across the disciplines of theatre and brain science in a way that both fields find useful.  

But here's my concern.  To use a personal metaphor, when it comes time for me to draw a larger picture for the public as I intend to try to do, your research publications are themselves the paints in my paintbox.  These paints must be fresh, true to form, and reliable.  No artist can paint with old pigments and it is important to have as many resources available as possible so as to create as complete a picture as possible.  Taking one to two years to add another color is simply unacceptable.

The big takeaway from all this is that this publication bottleneck is doing real damage to the field.  In the case of the arts, for example, the big advantage to what I do is that I get immediate feedback from my work.  Critical reviews in the paper, audience response, peer input, the works.  The arts are open and accessible and I can easily see the work of other great artists simply by buying a ticket.  Like you, we have conferences, but that's not generally where the latest work is shared.  As a result, the arts build on each other with a very fast turn around.  One need look no further than Super Bowl halftime shows to see how quickly new technology is integrated from one year to the next in an ever increasing artistic arms race.  To use a parallel with the sciences, what my director or I see on Broadway in one way or another is going to find its way into my shop (lab) in short order.

On the other hand, when I look for the latest research in my more scientific pursuits I know that the study I'm reading is based on work that may actually be years old.  Yes, the most recent studies may be in pre-publication and some authors have been very gracious to share those with me, but unless a best-selling researcher's name is on your work it is going to languish, apparently for years, doing no one any good.  And so, the latest research is not the latest research and I'm certainly not the only one who is frustrated by this state of affairs.

I'm hoping that the gatekeepers to knowledge (for that really is what they are) will be creative enough to resolve this problem and invest in the future on their end but I'm sure that the answer will ultimately be more collaborative.  Should universities and labs come to the table to establish better standards for education?  Should there be a re-evaluation among academia and scientific institutions of how critical publication is to a post-doc's future?  Does the pressure to publish contribute to the deception that sometimes occurs, thus increasing the need for closer scrutiny of the peer review process?  Should there be a better vetting and orientation process for reviewers and editors; better evaluative feedback at the outset; perhaps even more valid publication options?  Forgive me if I'm speaking out of turn here but these seem to be recurring themes in the article and the comments and what I do for a living is to ask questions that lead to creative problem solving -- and I care about the sciences.  We can't get the public excited about the work you do unless they hear about the work you do.

We have a saying in my world, "You can have it Cheap, Fast, or Good.  Pick any two."  If one wants quality publication in a short turn around time it's not going to be cheap if cheap is equated with low infrastructure investment (sometimes referred to as "cost efficiency").  The tension between quality and speed is also critically important.  I don't want to be embarassed by citing shoddy work any more than anyone else does. So the status quo seems to follow the formula that quality publications (advantageous to all concerned) can be produced with low infrastructure investment (advantageous to the publishers) but speed (advantageous to the field and the authors) is clearly sacrificed.    

I suppose the question everyone must answer is, "For the good of the field what are the critical priorities?"  My vote is for speed and quality for they most affect the results downstream in a timely manner.  That means you will need a robust infrastructure and a means to achieve it without sacrifice.

It seems this leaves the publishers (and other institutional parties with vested interests) with some serious work to do.  Not because they are the authors' easy targets, but because the field requires it.  If they are going to take responsibility as the gatekeepers of knowledge, then perhaps it's time to build some bigger gates.</dd>

							<dd>Interesting perspective from one with feet firmly in both the research and performance arts spheres.  Two members of my extended family-in laws--started out ass pre-meds but got BFAs.  The older is now a surgeon, the other is a musical theater performer and master class educator.  I would assume that there are opportunities for research and publication both in the performing arts and the pedagogy.  For the former, I remember reading an article on acting technique by Hume Cronin almost 60 years ago in high school drama class.  Another family member managed, along with his co-star, to reinvent the roles of Curly and Laurie in Oklahoma!, in the middle of a run, and make the romance more believable.  They never published, but I and other viewers knew and appreciated what had happened for the rest of the run</dd>

							<dd>As a PI, I must say that there are several important issues that have not been covered in the article or the subsequent discussion. First, lengthy reviews, and the stats in the paper show that there are basically only lengthy reviews, and several rounds of resubmission do not only delay publication but can also cause economic harm to a lab. I have just had two papers in the pipeline, one first-authored by a 5th year Ph.D. student who was writing up and the other one by a postdoc who was on parental leave. Additional work requested be the reviewers meant that I had to extent the Ph.D. student contract beyond my financial abilities in the first case and have other coworkers help finishing the paper in the other. I am in the lucky situation that I have a lab of a decent size and could, in the end, somehow afford this but it was difficult and the consequences will be felt elsewhere somewhere down the line. Many smaller labs, however, have tight budgets and cannot afford shuffling money and people around. They will have to capitulate when facing long lists of "additional work required". Second, I am in the lucky situation that I am working at a university where the duration of a Ph.D. is not regulated and delaying a Ph.D. thesis project to finish a paper is possible for me. But again, many of my colleagues in Europe have to graduate their Ph.D. students in four years. The work load that went into the above-mentioned papers is maybe in each case just about that (four years) and we have managed to publish the papers reasonably well and in the journals where we had initially submitted them. Would we have had to resubmit to another journal, the publication would have been delayed by another 6 - 12 months. Had my graduate student needed the paper to graduate, he would have been blocked. Fortunately, our graduate students also do not have to have published in order to graduate. But again, this is different in many other universities and countries. So, here the solution for the PI is often to have smaller and less risky projects, with a lower impact, to withstand the pressures from their universities and graduate schools. This cannot be in the interest of science. Third, grant funding! Our grants and many of the grants that I review from abroad provide funding for 3 years. If half of these three years has to be reserved for submissions, resubmissions and hopefully eventually publication, the time for experimentation until the next grant renewal shrinks considerably. At the same time, good high impact publications will be needed to obtain grant renewals. This can be very destructive situation, especially for a young PIs that may not have enough experienced coworkers from the start to drive projects forward. Journals like eLife that give a bonus to young researchers are helping those young PIs in the most efficient way but, to the best of my knowledge, not many other journals do that.</dd>

							<dd>All suffer.A few have courage to speak aloud .This writing is a superb iteration! In last few years , a few times and in few submissions ,my experience is same to same .Let me cite one of own unique stuff :I wrote a letter to editor in the response to  a original work in a front line journal .The response was though the comment looks OK,but I am sorry tell that we don't have space to accommodate .Kindly publish it somewhere else .You can imagine the editor for a front line journal a letter to editor to one of article published in his/her journal is can be published somewhere else ?It can be simply equated to sexual harassment in work place .The worker looks after a job but the employer or the person in power in office looks at you .</dd>

							<dd>I had an experience last year when I wrote a letter to the editor of Nature  commenting (favorably) on an article in the careers section.  I soon found out that LTEs are edited, by staff editors and the resulting give and take, although done fairly promptly, took several weeks.  One to Science several years ago, critical of a newsy item on research was dismissed out of hand. Apparently the issue had overseas political overtones and any discussion was forboten.  The issue died and has not been heard from since, not even citations, even though it proposed controversial findings in chemistry.  C'est la guerre.</dd>

							<dd>This is an excellent write up: as if the writer read my mind and my poll votes seems to align with the majority of authors who took part. I have always wondered why it has to take so long for us to publish our results and by the time we are done it is no more "new". I had the experience of waiting more than one year recently to get a paper published from the time of submission and commencement of review to acceptance took about 15 months! I think it can be better than this. At the end of the day the many reviews requested by the reviewers did not change the fundamental findings of the study. Another thing is that busy reviewers keep reviews pending for too long a time, imagine waiting for one reviewer for 3 months and in one case I had a reviewer who kept the editor and me waiting for about 6 months! This is not good for the academic community. If a reviewer is too busy he should decline the review and editors should not insist on particular reviewers and keep authors waiting unnecessarily for too long.</dd>

							<dd>As a PI, I must say that there are several important issues that have not been covered in the article or the subsequent discussion. First, lengthy reviews, and the stats in the paper show that there are basically only lengthy reviews, and several rounds of resubmission do not only delay publication but can also cause economic harm to a lab. I have just had two papers in the pipeline, one first-authored by a 5th year Ph.D. student who was writing up and the other one by a postdoc who was on parental leave. Additional work requested be the reviewers meant that I had to extent the Ph.D. student contract beyond my financial abilities in the first case and have other coworkers help finishing the paper in the other. I am in the lucky situation that I have a lab of a decent size and could, in the end, somehow afford this but it was difficult and the consequences will be felt elsewhere somewhere down the line. Many smaller labs, however, have tight budgets and cannot afford shuffling money and people around. They will have to capitulate when facing long lists of "additional work required". Second, I am in the lucky situation that I am working at a university where the duration of a Ph.D. is not regulated and delaying a Ph.D. thesis project to finish a paper is possible for me. But again, many of my colleagues in Europe have to graduate their Ph.D. students in four years. The work load that went into the above-mentioned papers is maybe in each case just about that (four years) and we have managed to publish the papers reasonably well and in the journals where we had initially submitted them. Would we have had to resubmit to another journal, the publication would have been delayed by another 6 - 12 months. Had my graduate student needed the paper to graduate, he would have been blocked. Fortunately, our graduate students also do not have to have published in order to graduate. But again, this is different in many other universities and countries. So, here the solution for the PI is often to have smaller and less risky projects, with a lower impact, to withstand the pressures from their universities and graduate schools. This cannot be in the interest of science. Third, grant funding! Our grants and many of the grants that I review from abroad provide funding for 3 years. If half of these three years has to be reserved for submissions, resubmissions and hopefully eventually publication, the time for experimentation until the next grant renewal shrinks considerably. At the same time, good high impact publications will be needed to obtain grant renewals. This can be very destructive situation, especially for a young PIs that may not have enough experienced coworkers from the start to drive projects forward. Journals like eLife that give a bonus to young researchers are helping those young PIs in the most efficient way but, to the best of my knowledge, not many other journals do that.</dd>

							<dd>I recently had an experience as a reviewer for a high quality cancer research journal that reflects some of the issues raised by this story and ideas of other commentators. My first impression of the manuscript, which I reviewed in the 2 week time frame requested, was that it had unusually valuable translational results for the management of a particular tumor type. But there were a few nagging methodological issues that I felt needed to be clarified to reduce the chances that the work, if published, would be unduly criticized. So I asked for clarification and edits as part of my review. The next version of the manuscript included some changes in response to my concerns but the central issue I had raised was not addressed. As the authors were from a non-English speaking country I imagined that they might not have fully understood  my comments, so I re-wrote them with greater detail. The next version came back with some more revisions but the same issues remained. I then read the manuscript again to make sure that I was not missing something about either my concerns or  their revisions, and discovered additional aspects of their data that contradicted some of the statements made in the manuscript, and wrote another review re-iterating my past concerns and raising the new ones (which mostly just illustrated more directly the source of my concerns). The reply from the authors included a statement in which they acknowledged that what they had said in the manuscript was not correct; they had meant something different. The central issue I had raised remained unaddressed. I then recommended to the editor that the manuscript be rejected (in part because I now had little faith in the quality of other parts of the work); it was. 

I don't believe that these authors had purposely been evasive or intended to obscure their methods (although they may have), but the lack of clarity I initially spotted (which I figured would be easily addressed with a few sentences) turned out to be an opening through which a major substantive methodologic problem was revealed. But even if this problem had not been present, peer review requiring multiple rounds is sometimes necessary to increase the chances that, for an particular manuscript, the scientific community can trust what it is reading. Of course, I don't doubt these authors will find another journal that will ultimately accept the manuscript without the core issue adequately addressed (or possibly even acknowledged).</dd>

							<dd>On a recent paper, published ADSAP and soon to appear in print, it was reviewed twice, the last after I had made several of the revisions requested (very helpful) but some remained unchanged which I justified.  This did not satisfy one reviewer who persisted in some misconceptions and implicitly questioned my expertise.  I successfully defended the revised manuscript.
In the past, I've reviewed several papers, mostly for the ACS Information Science Journals. Back in the day of written reviews and the report on carbon paper stacks, one had the option of letting the reviewers signature go through to the author's copy.  I agreed with the advice of Eugene Garfield and always let the author know who reviewed the paper.  That option is no longer available.</dd>

							<dd>Well, don't doubt it at all.
What is the goal of publishing? 
Isn't to make results or ideas public so that as many people as possible can read it and benefit from it, scientifically speaking? 
This is exactly what Preprint servers offer and they offer it for FREE and FAST! What to ask more?
So, YES, Preprint servers are good, even EXCELLENT. 
Then, if a paper is published in "traditional or prestigious journals" about the same subject, you will have the merit to be the first who addressed it. No scope for the paper published in the prestigious journal.
Do you really find any difference to read an article here or elsewhere? 
Are the letters or words printed here in "gold" or "diamond" and in "tin" in other journals? 
All print journals are printed in either black/white on the same paper material or they are published online and readable in either in Internet Explorer, Firefox or PDF or HTML formats!
That's it.
Gone the days that only a few rich publishers who were having money to buy big printers and papers to print and distribute.
We are in a new era: the era of online and Internet. No difference, all pages are white (or virtual).</dd>

							<dd>Its the 'benfit' part you seem to be overlooking. There is no benefit in wide dissemination of shoddy work. This isn't about the form that a scientific contribution is ultimately presented in (I can't remember the last time I actually handled a bound paper journal) but the reliability of the information within that contribution. There are plenty of high quality, electronic-only journals out there that haven't bought big printers, don't charge for colour, and have reasonably rapid turn around times, but they maintain good peer review practices so the work they publish is of high quality also. 'Free' and 'fast' are not good criteria for a scientist wanting to know where to focus their (very) few reading hours. 'Reliable' and 'significant' are far better, and that's what peer review is supposed to be there to ensure. In this era of electronic communication, many of the traditional journals now actually 'publish' a paper three times: once as an accepted manuscript, once as a typeset preprint, and once with the full volume and page numbers. The first two of these will be electronic only, the last will be both hard copy and virtual. With initiatives like this speeding things up already, if you aren't prepared to wait for peer review then what are you trying to hide?</dd>

							<dd>If you are ready to wait for years or as long as the examples given here, much good may it do to you, but I cannot. Most authors cannot. 
I can wait for a few weeks/months if I feel the manuscript will be really accepted with/out minor or major revisions, but not for months or years to get a rejection.
The 'shoddy work" you are talking about is simply a personal judgment. The opinions diverge as people do. Everyone has a different judgment.  
Do you really think that all published papers in top-tiers journals are worthwhile? 
You are certainly familiar with misconducts in research and you certainly have heard about retraction of papers in top-tiers journals. 
The quality is thus open and a debatable question.</dd>

							<dd>As we are indeed debating it. And as I've said below, the variation in perception and emphasis is the reason that peer review is normally a 2-4 person process, including the editor. Shoddy work is not just a personal judgement, there are very clear rules within the scientific method and if you choose to ignore them or subvert them (as I have seen done) the work carries less intrinsic value. I am really intrigued as to why you cannot wait a little while to get the work published. How long did you spend conducting it?</dd>

							<dd>As JPC D said, waiting for a year and then getting rejection is not nice. This Nature article is well written. When scientists do their work, they want to publish the work and let the public know what they found. Peer review is important but even some controversial scientific findings have gone through peer review system later to find the errors they contain.</dd>

							<dd>Well, my treatment clearly shows that the system is broken. To basically be told to "go play" by the editor and two reviewers of the journal after having been the author or co-author of dozens of technical reports and papers is insulting and non-professional. I did not expect instant publication, but at least professional feedback and request for rewrite and resubmittal. I have scratched that journal off of my list, both as a subscriber and potential place to publish.</dd>

							<dd>Commiserations on your treatment. However, your experience and your reaction to it are great examples of the sorts of credibility feedback in the system. 

There is one journal in my field that was once the absolute, unquestioned leader. However, it started to get a reputation as an old boys' club, younger researchers started to find it hard to publish unless they were proteges of leading names, and as a reviewer I noticed that my recommendations were often completely ignored (even where fairly significant) if the authorship of the manuscript included people that the editor was friendly with or didn't want to upset. This came to a head a few years ago when one article I reviewed so badly misrepresented itself (e.g. unconstrained samples taken from a waste heap dressed up as representative), and provided interpretation entirely unsupported by data, that I came as close as I ever have done to recommending rejection without even writing a report. A few months later I received the current contents alert for that journal and, lo, there was the paper, almost unaltered from the original manuscript. A few months on from that I happened to bump into the associate editor who has handled that submission and flat-out asked why she had let such a poor piece of work through. Her response was "I know, but the editor overruled me".

Needless to say, I haven't reviewed for them again, and I won't be publishing with them either. In the last few years this once-leading journal has had its impact factor dwindle and has been overtaken by two others in the field. Clearly it is not just me who has doubts about the quality of the work they present. However, it is not "the system" that is broken, but its implementation at that journal. Scientists talk outside of our journal submissions, and if you think that a journal is behaving badly then it will certainly be a topic that gets raised over a beer or two at the next conference.</dd>

							<dd>There is no difference between papers posted on Preprint servers and any other journals (even the most prestigious ones). They are readable and readers can judge by themselves. Those who rely on the (Where) rather than (What) authors publish does not deserve the name of 'scientists'. 
With Preprints no one can scope you; your interesting idea is already published and even if prestigious journals publish on the same idea as the yours, you have the merit to be the first to report on it and you have the proof (your Preprint version). That's all the merit.
Administrators are often "business guys" who think money much more than science. Don't let business guys or immature administrators spoil science with biased visions on where one should publish. 
If scientists in the past (Romains, Greek, Mandel, Einstein, etc.) were hindered by biased peer-review, we would not enjoy from the scientific knowledge we enjoy nowadays.</dd>

							<dd>So your solution is to entirely do away with the peer review process? Frankly, that's a very bad decision and I really do have to question your motivation for that. Sure, some people who are specialist in their field may be able to judge a paper on its strengths and flaws, but many papers are read by people who are not already completely familiar with a topic and are attempting to learn something new. That is, after all, the whole point of publishing. Peer review shouldn't be biased, but the reason there are normally two or three reviewers in addition to the editor (and also associate editor in many cases) is that scientists are human and opinions vary. This is a strength of peer review, not a weakness. Preprint servers offer cheap and quick, but does that mean good? I doubt it.</dd>

							<dd>Don't doubt it at all.
What is the goal of publishing? 
Isn't to make results or ideas public so that as many people as possible can read it and benefit from it, scientifically speaking? 
This is exactly what Preprint servers offer and they offer it for FREE and FAST! What to ask more?
So, YES, Preprint servers are good, even EXCELLENT. 
Then, if a paper is published in "traditional or prestigious journals" about the same subject, you will have the merit to be the first who addressed it. No scope for the paper published in the prestigious journal.
Do you really find any difference to read an article here or elsewhere? 
Are the letters or words printed here in "gold" or "diamond" and in "tin" in other journals? 
All print journals are printed in either black/white on the same paper material or they are published online and readable in either in Internet Explorer, Firefox or PDF or HTML formats!
That's it.
Gone the days that only a few rich publishers who were having money to buy big printers and papers to print and distribute.
We are in a new era. The era of online and Internet. No difference, all pages are white (or virtual).</dd>

							<dd>I sent a paper out beforehand to the editor of a prestigious multi-author volume dedicated to Gulf Coast archaeology for review, edit, and comment. After receiving his blessings, I submitted my paper on the San Patrice culture to a premier archaeological journal. The archaeological journal rejected it, citing one reviewer as basically saying that Dalton ruled the South and San Patrice was an upstart that needed to be put in its place in the order of things. The other anonymous reviewer stated that there was no such thing as a deeply stratified archaeological site in the uplands, that they were all deflated. The reviewer went on to say that anybody who thought otherwise was a crackpot who did not deserved to be published. These reviewers were clearly bias. Reviewers should weight the science and merit of the paper, not judge it based on whether they personally agree with the subject or its results. I protested the attitude and unprofessional responses of the two reviewers to the journal, which then rejected my request to have the paper sent to different reviewers.</dd>

							<dd>Thanks for these valuable comments and discussion on this topic. As editor of this story, I want to speak to the point earlier in this comment stream, suggesting that the scientists in it who received multiple rejections did so because their work 'wasn’t very good'. We considered this in
the reporting and editing. We chose these stories because they are typical of many researchers’ experiences, and also because the reporting suggested that the work was of good quality: once it was published, it was favourably received by other researchers.   

Regarding the point that Nature should disclose its interests - the story tried to make
that clear. We highlighted Nature’s wait times in the article, and our reporter included comment from Nature’s editorial director, as a representative of the journal component of the publication.  Nature’s journal and magazine components have editorial independence.</dd>

							<dd>I did not understand what you wrote:
once you wrote "their work wasn’t very good"
then you wrote "the work was of good quality: once it was published, it was favourably received by other researchers"
So was it good or not? 
I my opinion this only proofs that Editors (as every human) makes mistakes. You should have at least courage to see the truth before our eyes. For me if other researches used and cited the work it is more important than if it was published in Nature.

And please do not say that you want to spare reviewers by not sending too many manuscripts for peer review (we already working for free and I do not think this makes difference for you). Why do you think Editor can judge in 10 minutes better than two or three reviewers in few hours. Your job is to wait for reviews and then having them in hands deciding, if the reviews are contradictory, then you add extra reviewer and that is it. Now, a lot of editorial rejections are only politics, who is who etc. Please, show me 10 publications from last 10 Nature issues which were published by young, "inexperienced" researches (small number of publications, institution outside USA or Europe, not supported by PI who is in the field &gt;20-30 years). Good luck.</dd>

							<dd>I'd be interested to know what the definition of "favourably received" was here. At one end of the scale this can mean that the work is truly redefining the paradigm for a whole field of research; at the other it may fall under 'mundane but competent'. A high profile, highly cited journal is going to have stiff competition for its publication slots, so work is going to have to be extremely significant to even get a look. At the other end, plenty of competent, reliable work is published in low impact journals, but the work only builds slightly on previous observations, or simply adds a case study to an already accepted theory without any greater insight into the fundamental process. I could name whole journals in my field that live on this type of manuscript. Both cases might be well received, but the prestige will be very different.

The balance between scientific impact and journal impact factor is key. Were these authors trying to get an observational paper into journals that habitually publish key theoretical and process model data? Using my own field again, if you produce a paper that simply describes the geology of an area then there will, somewhere, be a journal that will take the manuscript and publish it, but that will likely be of regional distribution and have a very low single digit impact factor. If from your geological mapping you provide key insights into the evolution a terrane, the processes of ore formation, preservation of fossil fauna, or some other information that can be used elsewhere then you'll find that a whole bunch of other journals are suddenly interested, and these will have concomitantly higher impact factors. At the apex, your mapping work may reveal details of a key marker that provides novel insight into fundamental earth system processes (magma genesis, plate tectonics, mantle composition, atmosphere evolution, or some-such) and at that point you start looking for a journal with sufficient profile to ensure widespread dissemination of the work. These outlets, of which Nature is one, are excruciatingly competitive and have very high impact factors to match.

Multiple rejections of manuscripts are not typical of the experience I see as an author and a reviewer. I don't know whether it is that the geosciences don't have the frenetic competition of biological sciences, but I have never known a paper be rejected without even a review unless the manuscript is awful or the author has pitched it to a journal that simply isn't suitable. The process of 'journal shopping' as described in this article seems to be mostly about authors trying to squeeze every last impact factor drop from their work. If that delays their publication then it's on their head, and isn't a function of the publication process itself.</dd>

							<dd>Actually, over 50% of the blame is on "top" journals editors (this is the level of editorial rejections). They simply reject papers without review with formal letter only. The true reasons are never presented. This is totally grey zone (they can do what they wish and nobody complains as maybe ... maybe ... one day in future they will allow me to publish here so I must be nice not to close the doors).

And from IF&gt;10 I could say from personal experience (&gt;10 years in science) that more important is who are the authors, not how important is the content. Content must be ok obviously, but if the manuscript author's list do not contain well known PI(s) in the field, Nobel prize winners, prestigious institutes in affiliation you can forget about publishing something there. Simply, you are wasting your time.</dd>

							<dd>In defence of the 'notoriously slow' social sciences it should be pointed out that most of our major journals appear much less frequently - quarterly or bi-monthly so that there is inevitably more of a lag between acceptance and publication within a constrained page budget. The various online early view schemes have helped with this but don't necessarily influence some of the metrics quoted here. As an editor, my biggest frustration is probably the time taken to find reviewers. Each person who is approached and declines, or doesn't respond at all, adds about 14 days to the timeline. With my journal, we are commonly approaching 4 people to get two volunteers and have had to go to as many as 12 on some occasions. As others have commented here, the community has not solved the problem that scholars as authors want prompt, timely and constructive reviews while the same scholars as reviewers don't want to be distracted from their own research or other professional commitments which count for much more in the performance reviewed world of many universities. I doubt whether preprints are going to make much impact because they are unlikely to count for much in the metrics respected by university managements.</dd>

							<dd>Besides a long time taken, an important point is that many a times reviewers of even editors do not have a proper understanding of the field, and their decision (of rejecting an article) are based on their little or no knowledge of the subject. 

As a recent example, I submitted a manuscript (SREP-15-08404) to the Scientific Reports, wherein it was showed that nearly 30% of unstimulated bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) dies off at 24 hours time point. Despite a number of article showing similar results (e.g. 'A Bcl-2-dependent molecular timer regulates the lifespan and immunogenicity of dendritic cells', URL: http://www.nature.com/ni/journal/v5/n6/full/ni1071.html), the manuscript was rejected with editor's comment "The major problem and the strong reason for the rejection is that the PI+ cells (necrotic) in control conditions are about 30-40%. It is too high to accept. This shows basic culture conditions are not optimum." 

If we talk about appeal, I must mention here that it took nearly one month for the above manuscript to undergo editorial review (priority review). And Nature journals took the appeal secondary which means another 2 to 3 months or so. 

Therefore, the publishing in the journals is really a frustrating and time consuming. Moreover, acceptance or rejection is (many a times) just a matter of chance.</dd>

							<dd>My personal observation places more of the blame on the authors than the journals.

As mature scientists, we should be able to judge what does and doesn't deserve to be written up.  The papers we write should be clear and have meaningful conclusions.  We should be able to judge which journal is the appropriate venue, at least by the second try.

I review plenty of papers that need only minimal comments because the authors write well and are convincing.  Those authors rarely complain about protracted review processes.</dd>

							<dd>You can hardly blame the delay caused by shopping around at several journals on the editing/reviewing process. The time taken by the reviewers is also a function of the number of papers being published. Reviewers themselves are under the same pressure as authors (to publish more and more). One could ask Fraser, how many papers has she reviewed and how much time did she take each time? Did she just rubber stamp everything as fine, or did she suggest improvements/alternatives? Quickly rubber stamping everything would definitely speed up the process. It would also make for terrible science.

Most troubling is the idea that "reviews don't fundamentally change the conclusions". Why bother with reviews, because it doesn't really change the conclusions? This is a classic sign of bad science and bad scientists.  Good science is not about the headlines but about the details. Whether the headlines are valid or depends entirely on boring details.  The headline can, should and does change things "fundamentally" if what is suggested by the reviewers doesn't work out. The headline could be completely wrong, partially wrong, wrong in a certain context, or right, depending on the details.</dd>

							<dd>There is clearly a conflict of interest. Nature and/or Nature's publishers clearly benefit from the current publication system. They cannot present themselves as "neutral hosts" for the discussion, they must fully disclose their interests in the game, either Nature's and/or the publishers.

							<dd>Axios is surprisingly effective: once we've found a journal that wants the paper to be submitted, the acceptance rate rises to 85%. Better still, only half of the accepted papers were sent for additional review by the journal. These percentages are based on hundreds of articles and include papers in good field-specific journals like Ecology Letters, American Naturalist and Molecular Ecology.

[PS I founded Axios and am hence not a neutral observer, but since what we're doing is so relevant to the problems raised in this article I thought it worth adding a comment]</dd>

							<dd>A somewhat similar situation to those described in the article was a large factor in my decision to leave academia and pursue a career in industry.  A paper that was a large part of my dissertation was sent out for lengthy review at three journals before it's ultimate publication, and each iteration resulted in several months of addressing reviewer criticisms.  Ultimately, I ended up spending nearly two years doing experiments that, as described in the article, strengthened, but did nothing to change the major conclusions instead of being able to pursue the genuinely exciting hypotheses generated by the research.
I've since discovered that the need to produce and sell a physical product streamlines industrial science and encourages much more rigor than academia where the need to publish quickly in top tier journals disincentivizes questioning of positive or flashy results.</dd>

Have you ever heard about something 'subjective'? 
You might like Hamburger but others do not necessarily, and inversely.
Sorry, but people like you are harming the science.

							<dd>Reading this article troubled me; not because of the supposed wait times for publication, but because the authors interviewed apparently couldn't take a hint. To have multiple out-of-hand rejections, without review, strongly suggests that the manuscript or work that they were trying to get out simply wasn't very good. As a reviewer I have frequently had manuscripts turn up on my 'desk' that are almost unreadable; poor structure, bad English, absurd diagrams, you name it. Then you have the work itself, which in many cases has significant flaws (some of which can be fairly sneakily obscured) and even outright misinterpretations of simple data. These are usually reasons that I will send a fairly terse message back to the editor with a flat rejection recommendation, or at least one for significant revisions.

Compared with when I started reviewing work, over a decade ago, it seems to be more common now that authors treat the peer review process as a glorified copy edit. I have had more than one university academic comment to me on this, using phrases amounting to 'let's just get it submitted, we can tidy it up after the review'. This is simply not ethical on the part of the author, as almost all reviewers are unpaid and do not have time to try and assess the scientific merit of work (peer review's principal function) through a fog of abysmal grammar, illogical structure, poorly supported assertions dressed up as conclusions, and incomplete descriptions.

My experience is that if you receive an outright rejection, either before or after review, this isn't a comment on the length of time that a paper takes to get published, but the quality of your written work. Good journals will accept good papers; some are faster than others at processing the review, but this apparent 'journal shopping' process is just authors wanting to find the best home for under-par work, without actually putting the effort in up front to make sure that their manuscript is of a quality commensurate with the journal they are submitting to.</dd>

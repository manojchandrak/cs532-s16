<![CDATA[
nce complemented by excellent death bowling from Bhuvneshwar Kumar enabled Sunrisers Hyderbad record an emphatic 10-wicket victory over Gujarat Lions in a lopsided Indian Premier League encounter, in Rajkot on Thursday.</p> <p>While Bhuvneshwar Kumar (4/29) helped Sunrisers restrict Gujarat Lions to 135/8 in 20 overs, skipper Warner continued his dream form as he plundered an unbeaten 74 off 48 balls with Sunrisers winning by a canter in only 14.5 overs. Warner had nine fours in his innings.</p> <p>Shikhar Dhawan also showed signs of returning to form with an unbeaten 53 off 41 balls with five boundaries.</p> <p>While Sunrisers won their second outing in four games, it was the first loss for the Suresh Raina-led outfit.</p> <p>The match was as good as lost for the Lions after they failed to notch up a decent total. But whatever dreams they harboured of early breakthroughs turned into nightmare as Warner creamed the bowling with utter disdain notching up his third half-century in four matches.</p> <p>His sequence of scores in the IPL read as: 58, 13, 90 no and 74 no. With 235 runs, Warner crossed KKR captain Gautam Gambhir as the current &#8216;Orange Cap&#8217; holder in the league.</p> <p>The 50 came off 29 balls with seven boundaries and he completely eased the pressure on a struggling Dhawan giving him ample time to get a few valuable runs under his belt.</p> <p>Warner started with two boundaries off Dale Steyn&#8217;s bowling in the very first over. The first through third man and the next a slash over point.</p> <p>He upped the ante in Praveen Kumar&#8217;s second over with successive cover drives and a straight hit past the bowler.</p> <p>When a desperate Raina introduced himself into the attack, Warner also hit him for a couple of boundaries as runs flowed through his bat with ease. Dhawan at the other end was sensible enough to nudge around for the singles and give the skipper bulk of the strike.</p> <p>The win came when Warner played a deft late cut off Ravindra Jadeja to finish the match in style.</p> <p>As of today, save one game, all teams chasing have won their respective matches.</p> <p>Earlier, skipper Raina hit a stroke-filled 75 but Sunrisers Hyderabad bowlers showed a lot of discipline to restrict Gujarat Lions to a modest 135 for eight after putting the home team in to make first use of the wicket.</p> <p>Courtesy Raina&#8217;s 51-ball knock that comprised nine fours, Lions&#8217; score got some sort of respectability as the other batsmen failed to get going on a two-paced wicket where stroke-making proved to difficult.</p> <p>The second best score after Raina was Brendon McCullum&#8217;s 18, which pretty much tells the sorry state of Lions&#8217; batting on the night.</p> <p>Bhuvneshwar (4/29) returned with best figures as he got three wickets in the final over of the Gujarat innings.</p> <p>Bangladesh&#8217;s seam bowling sensation Mustafizur Rahaman once again bowled a miserly spell giving away only 19 runs in 4 overs, while getting the wicket of Ravindra Jadeja (14) wicket with a well disguised off-cutter.</p> <p>The last five overs of the innings produced a mere 31 runs with the loss of four wickets.</p> <p>While Bhuvneshwar should be lauded for his three-wicket burst in the final over, the pressure increased because Sunrisers skipper David Warner carefully kept three overs of the Bangladeshi pacer at the death as he bowled the 15th, 17th and 19th over without letting Gujarat off the hook.</p> <p>With no support from the other end, it became difficult for a seasoned pro like Raina, as he started in style with cover drives, shots on the on-side.</p> <p>But at the other end, wickets fell at regular intervals with McCullum trying a slog sweep off Bipul Sharma and the in-form Aaron Finch was bowled by Bhuvneshwar in the innings&#8217; first over itself.</p> <p>The only six of the innings came off McCullum&#8217;s blade, even as Sunrisers bowlers bowled an unprecedented 38 dot balls, which is equivalent to 6.2 overs without any run.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2764452&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

<img class="wp-image-2764356 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/yuvraj_pti-m.jpg" /> Yuvraj Singh sustained an ankle injury while playing against Australia during the World T20. (Source: PTI) <p>Recuperating from an ankle injury, India all-rounder Yuvraj Singh on Thursday said the IPL should not be blamed for the prevailing water crisis in the drought-hit Maharashtra and added the tournament must go on.</p> <p>The Bombay High Court recently ordered shifting of all Indian Premier League matches, scheduled post April 30, from the state owing to the severe water crisis.</p> <p>The state was originally scheduled to host 20 IPL matches in Mumbai, Nagpur and Pune.</p> <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think IPL has got to do anything with what the situations are in India. We play in a sport and try to excel in that. I don&#8217;t think there is any reason that IPL should not go on,&#8221; the 2007 World Twenty20 and 2011 World Cup winner said at the launch of sportswear company Puma&#8217;s bold Tricks collection in Mumbai.</p> <p>&#8220;Regarding the permission, it is not my job to say anything, as my job as a cricketer is to play cricket. Whatever venue I go to play, whatever venue we are told to go to play, we will just go out and play,&#8221; the 34-year-old added.</p> <p>Yuvraj, who sustained an ankle injury while playing against Australia during the World T20, missed the first three games for Sunrisers Hyderabad in the ongoing ninth edition of IPL and is hopeful of returning to action against Gujarat Lions on May 6.</p> <p>&#8220;I am looking to play the game on May 6. Hopefully, I should be ready by then. I am not fully certain that I will play on 6th May, but my target is to play on the sixth. I had a go ahead from my doctor yesterday, so hopefully will play,&#8221; Yuvraj said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2764348&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: BCCI) <p>In order to raise the ever dwindling number of spectators in the stadium, the BCCI is all set to host its first-ever Day/Night cricket Test with pink ball when New Zealand tour India later this year.</p> <p>&#8220;We have decided that we will play one Day/Night Test match with pink ball against New Zealand later this year. Before that Duleep Trophy will act as a dress rehearsal for the Day/Night Test match,&#8221; BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur told a select gathering of mediapersons at the BCCI&#8217;s headquarters in the capitalon Thursday.</p> <p>Thakur said that the main objective of the Duleep Trophy will be to check how the pink kookaburra behaves under the light in sub-continental conditions.</p> <p>&#8220;While we have not zeroed in on the venue, there are lots of factors that need to be taken into account. Things like dew factor, how the spinners bowl with the pink kookaburra on Indian pitches. These things we will get an idea during the Duleep Trophy,&#8221; said Thakur.</p> <p>It is expected that all leading Indian players will play in that Duleep game in order to get an idea and also give a feedback to the board before they go ahead with the Test match.</p> <p>While Test matches in India are played with &#8216;SG Test&#8217; balls, Thakur said that in this upcoming match it will be &#8216;Pink kookaburra&#8217; that will be used.</p> <p>&#8220;We may ask SG to manufacture pink balls later but that has to be of the quality of pink balls that kookaburra produces,&#8221; said Thakur.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2764308&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Express File Photo by Prem nath Pandey) <p>The members of the Indian Premier League&#8217;s governing council are likely to deliberate on whether the 2017 edition of the cash-rich tourney can be held abroad, BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur revealed on Thursday. <strong>(<a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/indian-premier-league-t20-2016-schedule-full-fixtures-results-schedule-time-and-more/">Fixtures</a> | <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ipl-2016-schedule-teams-tickets-squad-auction-9-streaming/">Squads</a>)</strong></p> <p>&#8220;The IPL governing council will be looking at the venues in India and abroad. We have to check the availability of the venues and prevailing conditions,&#8221; Thakur told a select gathering of journalists during an interaction at the BCCI&#8217;s Delhi office.</p> <p>IPL has been twice played outside India both being assembly election years. In 2009, the league was moved for the entire duration to South Africa, while in 2014, it was shifted to the United Arab Emirates for the first 15 days. That the BCCI top brass is deliberating on the issue was clear when BCCI treasurer Aniruddh Chaudhary had tweeted four days back: &#8220;Very soon IPL may be played outside the country, if this goes on. Loss to the GDP would not be insignificant.&#8221;</p> <p>The IPL has been rocked by one controversy after another from its inception year but during this edition, the spate of<br /> Public Interest Litigations (PIL) filed by various organisations has thrown the itinerary into disarray.</p> <p>Already 12 IPL matches have been moved out of drought-hit Maharashtra on the Bombay High Court&#8217;s directive after a PIL was filed claiming that a substantial quantity of water was being used in maintaining the various cricket stadiums in the state. &#8220;I have asked the state units to check water-harvesting structure,&#8221; Thakur said.</p> <p>The BCCI secretary also said in no uncertain terms that if the Lodha Committee recommendations pertaining to curtailment of advertisement is implemented, then it will have a sharp negative impact on BCCI&#8217;s revenue structure. &#8220;We will have to rethink about the gratis (pension) that is paid to ex-players (former Test and first class cricketers),&#8221; Thakur said.</p> <p>The value of broadcast rights post-2017 will also be significantly less if the BCCI has to implement the Lodha Committee recommendations in its current form.</p> <p>It is also understood that current players, who get 26 percent of BCCI&#8217;s annual income in their salaries may face a<br /> pay cut, so will the IPL franchises, which get a share of the revenue from the BCCI.</p> <p>There is a school of thought that if there is a drop in revenue and players take a pay-cut, the BCCI will then be compelled to allow them to ply their trade in foreign T20 leagues like the &#8216;Big Bash&#8217;, Caribbean Premier League (CPL), Bangladesh Premier League, to name a few.</p> <p>In another move, the BCCI is mulling on having a commentators&#8217; academy where those who would aspire a career behind the microphone will get to hone their skills. &#8220;We are planning to have a commentators&#8217; academy where interested youngsters who want to take up the profession will be able to hone their skills. And it will cater to various regional languages. We have seen how Virender Sehwag&#8217;s commentary has struck a chord with the cricket lovers during the recently-concluded World T20,&#8221; said Thakur.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2764298&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

<img class="size-full wp-image-2763967" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/tinobestl.jpg" alt="Tino Best, Tino Best book, Tino Best girls book, Best Book, Best autobiography, Mind the windows, Tino, sports news sports, cricket news, Cricket" /> Tino Best&#8217;s upcoming book has a foreword by Andrew Flintoff. <p>Former West Indies cricketer Tino Best has revealed personal secrets in his upcoming book &#8216;Mind the Windows: My Story&#8217;. The Barbados quickie revealed that he had sex with more than 500 women while he used to be on tours with the West Indies cricket team.</p> <p>One of the excerpts from the book, <strong><a href="http://www.news.com.au/sport/sports-life/west-indies-cricket-star-tino-best-reveals-he-slept-with-more-than-500-women/news-story/a12208e88e1317c710d8786891c8638c" target="_blank">as reported by news.com.au</a></strong>, read, “I love girls — and girls love me. I reckon I’m the best-looking bald-headed guy in the world. I joke about being the black Brad Pitt! “Everywhere I went as a cricketer, I’d talk to girls, date girls and sleep with girls. I reckon I’ve slept with anywhere between 500 and 650 girls, all around the world.</p> <p><strong>LOOK: <a href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/sports-gallery/former-west-indies-seamer-tino-best-reveals-all-in-upcoming-book-2764102/">SNEAK PEEK INTO TINO BEST&#8217;S INSTAGRAM DIARIES</a></strong></p> <p>“I had a beautiful baby called Tamani with my first love Melissa but things went bad with us. The lads had told me that, once I took wickets for Barbados, she’d come running back for me.</p> <p>“I had done just that but she hadn’t. When she called it a day, I became a bit of a playboy. Put it this way: I was a man whore.</p> <p>“If I liked a girl, I’d go and talk to them — whoever it was. If I’d seen Beyonce and she was single, I’d have gone and introduced myself: ‘Hello, my name’s Tino. What’s yours?’ No girl intimidated me.</p> <p>“I’d pick and choose who I wanted to date. I used to go on five or six dates a week, all with different girls.</p> <p>“So, yes, I was a man whore. I’d have to juggle them round. One on one day, another on another day. I was young and loving the lifestyle.</p> <p>“We used to go on tour with the West Indies — and away with Barbados — and see how many girls we could enjoy.</p> <p>“If I went to Australia and saw a nice-looking blonde, I’d want to date them. If I went to South Africa and saw a gorgeous brunette, I’d want to go out for a bit with her.</p> <p>“I always used to tease my teammates and tell them that, if they didn’t play cricket, they wouldn’t get the girls. I’d get girls because I’m good looking, I’d joke!</p> <p>“We used to have competitions of who could shag the most girls on tour. I think my record, on an eleven-week tour to Australia in 2005, was more than 40.</p> <p>“I was 24 and I didn’t play a Test on that tour. The coach, Bennett King, didn’t fancy me one bit. He must have been the only one who didn’t!</p> <p>“I’d go out, pick up a couple of girls and take them back to our hotel. A plush hotel with a professional sportsman: the girls loved it.</p> <p>“Sometimes I’d take back four girls on one night! If that happened, I’d have to call one of the other lads for back-up to help me out.</p> <p>“I’ve had plenty of threesomes, or menages a trois, as I like to call them. One night I had three girls at once. That’s the most I’ve ever done stuff with.</p> <p>“I wasn’t getting any play on the field in Australia — but I was at night.</p> <p>“The greatest night of my life was in 2004. I had my first menage a trois in the Crowne Plaza hotel in Birmingham. Wow.</p> <p>“I went for dinner with two beautiful girls and took them back to my room. That blew my mind.”</p> <p>The West Indies player said that the Australian girls were the ones he would go crazy about.</p> <p>“The most beautiful girls are the Australians. I think they are amazing. They are really into their fitness and have amazing bodies.</p> <p>The flamboyant Caribbean bowler never mixed up his fun with his business. Even after a busy night, he used to be the first one to go out and train.</p> <p>“Did any of this affect my cricket? No, not at all. I don’t think it hindered me. There was no one who trained harder than me for Barbados or the West Indies.</p> <p>“If I bring two girls back and have sex with them, I’ll still be out there first in the morning working hard. I was smart about it and didn’t get into any trouble.</p> <p>“I respected that I played for my country and did everything I could — but I liked enjoying myself, too.</p> <p>“People used to know me in Barbados but it was different abroad. A lot of girls recognised me and said I was familiar but they thought I was an American who played American Football or something.</p> <p>“That suited me. I didn’t tell them I played cricket for the West Indies. They just knew I was a professional sportsman and thought I must have been on vacation.”</p> <p>“There was a news story that came out in September 2015 when Chris Gayle went on Instagram to post about his strip club.</p> <p>“He put up a picture and wrote, ‘From the pool to the strip club&#8230;if u don’t have a strip club at home, U ain’t a cricket ‘Player’ .. I always make sure my guest well entertained and feel like they are at home #LifeIsForLiving #DreamBig.’</p> <p>Best also came up with the fact that it was Dwayne Bravo who used to be the &#8216;partner in crime&#8217; with him.</p> <p>“Now, Chris is good fun but he doesn’t indulge in too much bad stuff. He’s a good man, Chris. The most fun on a night out is Dwayne Bravo.</p> <p>“We complemented each other very well when we played for the West Indies together. I’ll give him an award now: He’s the best wingman going!”</p> <p>“The girls are great but the best thing about being a cricketer is the days on the field. Nothing can beat pulling on the whites of your country and going into battle.</p> <p>“It’s a feeling like no other. Some people ask me the worst thing about being a cricketer and, you know what? There isn’t a single thing I don’t enjoy.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2763901&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: Express Photo by Ravi Kanojia) <p>Ben Stokes thrives on his battles with some of the sport&#8217;s most competitive players as it tends to bring out the best in the feisty England all-rounder, who is hoping to recover quickly from his nightmare end to the World Twenty20 tournament.</p> <p>Stokes, who has scored three Test centuries, has clashed with several players over the past year, most notably an ongoing feud with West Indies all-rounder Marlon Samuels.</p> <p><strong>READ:</strong> <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/kane-williamson-ben-stokes-make-through-wisdens-top-five-cricketers-of-2015/">Stokes in Wisden&#8217;s top five cricketers of 2015</a></p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m always thinking about the private battle, even in the field. I&#8217;m always trying to be better than the other person I&#8217;m against,&#8221; the 24-year-old told the Times newspaper on Thursday.</p> <p>&#8220;There are guys that you look at and you want to really bowl at them or bat against them, certain guys who really get your juices flowing. They tend to be similar characters to me: (Australia batsman) David Warner, for example.</p> <p>&#8220;I love playing against these guys who have the same attitude to the game that I have. It&#8217;s always been there, that competitive instinct&#8230; I just want to win.&#8221;</p> <p><strong>READ:</strong><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/it-was-just-complete-devastation-ben-stokes-recalls-last-over-against-west-indies/"> Stokes recalls last over against West Indies in final</a></p> <p>By claiming four wickets and five catches at the World Twenty20 in India, Stokes played a crucial role in England&#8217;s run to the final in Kolkata on April 3, especially with his bowling at the death.</p> <p>However, in the last over against the West Indies, who needed 19 runs to clinch their second T20 World Cup, Stokes was hit for four successive sixes by Carlos Brathwaite, ending England&#8217;s own hopes of a second triumph in disastrous fashion.</p> <p>While Stokes <strong><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/west-indies-vs-england-ben-stokes-extinguishes-england-fire/">admitted he was &#8220;devastated&#8221;</a></strong>, he also claimed his growing maturity as a player helped him deal with the situation with a better frame of mind.</p> <p>&#8220;I just sat there with a towel on my head, utterly devastated. I didn&#8217;t want to walk out there slumped and beaten and looking like I felt inside,&#8221; Stokes said.</p> <p>&#8220;A few years ago, I would have really tortured myself about that final over. I used to find it so hard to let go, but I&#8217;m a lot better now.</p> <p>&#8220;You can never beat your own mind when it plays tricks on you. I&#8217;m learning to cope a lot better with the bad times now.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2763829&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

Kings XI Punjab will be playing 3 home games in Dharamsala as the team has opted for this venue as second home ground. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2763576&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: BCCI) <p>There seems to be no end to confusion with regards to shifting of Kings XI Punjab&#8217;s three IPL home matches after the franchise issued an official statement naming Dharamsala as their second home venue. <strong>(<a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/indian-premier-league-t20-2016-schedule-full-fixtures-results-schedule-time-and-more/">Fixtures</a> | <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ipl-2016-schedule-teams-tickets-squad-auction-9-streaming/">Squads</a>)</strong></p> <p>Conflicting reports emerged when highly-placed sources in the BCCI were contacted, a few hours after KIXP&#8217;s<br /> announcement. &#8220;It is weird but we are left a little confused after we heard that Kings XI Punjab had issued a statement naming Dharamsala as their home ground. It is a bit confusing as there seems to be distinct lack of communication at their end,&#8221; a top BCCI official said on condition of anonymity.</p> <p>It has become even more intriguing as a HPCA spokesperson said that despite KXIP&#8217;s announcement, they are not sure whether the match would take place or not. &#8220;After the manner in which the venue lost the Pakistan match in the World T20, we are wary about the politics being played by the state government as the Himachal Pradesh CA president Anurag Thakur is a <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> MP,&#8221; the HPCA spokesperson said after KXIP issued the statement.</p> <p>It has been learnt that one of their promoters had told the top brass of BCCI that they would like to host all their matches at Mohali as it is cost-effective and choosing Dharamsala has now sent conflicting signals.</p> <p>&#8220;We are happy to announce that Kings XI Punjab will be playing our 3 home games in Dharamshala. We are grateful and thankful to Anurag Thakur and the HPCA for their support in helping us make this transition seamless at such short notice,&#8221; KXIP had earlier said in a statement.</p> <p>When they were specifically asked if they had issued the statement after consulting with the BCCI, sources close to the KXIP management could not give a definitive answer. However, they maintained that all promoters are on same page regarding the shift of venue.</p> <p>Kings XI Punjab co-owner Ness Wadia said: &#8220;I guess there has been some confusion as our first choice of venue is Dharamsala for the three matches. But in case there are problems then we will be playing at Mohali.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2763576&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: PTI) <p>His own knock was crucial in Mumbai Indians chasing down a stiff 171-run target but skipper Rohit Sharma chose to credit all-rounder Krunal Pandya for the IPL win over Royal Challengers Bangalore, saying that the youngster is proving to be a game-changer in every match. <strong>(<a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/indian-premier-league-t20-2016-schedule-full-fixtures-results-schedule-time-and-more/">Fixtures</a> | <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ipl-2016-schedule-teams-tickets-squad-auction-9-streaming/">Squads</a>)</strong></p> <p>Mumbai defeated Bangalore by six wickets on Wednesday night with Krunal, who is the brother of India player Hardik Pandya, grabbing 2/27 in his four overs.</p> <p>&#8220;He (Krunal) has been impressive. Even in the first game he played here against Gujarat Lions, he did not get wickets but bowled four overs for just 20 runs and, then he did it with the bat in Hyderabad, scored 49 off just 25-26 balls and again today getting those two big important wickets in the middle (A B de Villiers and <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/virat-kohli/">Virat Kohli</a>) was very crucial from the team&#8217;s perspective,&#8221; Rohit said in the post-match press conference.</p> <p>&#8220;I think he has got something about him, he knows his bowling really well and he understands the conditions really well, so it makes my job easier as a captain he sets his own field which is I think very crucial. It shows that you have got lot of confidence into your bowling,&#8221; he added.</p> <p><strong>READ: <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ipl-2016-so-where-the-next-generation-of-indian-cricketers-is-coming-from-2762776/">So where the next generation of Indian cricketers is coming from?</a></strong></p> <p>RCB seemed set for a big score when Kohli (33) and de Villiers (29) were marching ahead but Krunal picked up both of them in a single over and halted the momentum.</p> <p>Rohit also stressed on the importance of having the right team combination and said the team&#8217;s theory of playing two overseas seamers has been helpful.</p> <p>&#8220;That theory (playing two overseas seamers) has worked for us over the years,&#8221; he said.</p> <p>Rohit said since he has luxury of having five bowlers, he can mix the attack well.</p> <p><strong>READ: <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ipl-2016-mi-vs-rcb-rohit-sharma-helps-mumbai-indians-end-losing-streak-2762719/">On home turf, bowlers, Rohit Sharma show Mumbai Indians way</a></strong></p> <p>&#8220;.. that is something which will keep going and as far as our batting is concerned, it looks more settled with (Ambati) Rayadu batting at three and myself batting at the top of the order. We wanted Pollard to get back in form as quickly as possible and today was a perfect day for him,&#8221; he added.</p> <p>Pollard made a 19-ball 40 on Wednesday.</p> <p>RCB spinner Iqbal Abdulla said Rohit made all the difference with his 44-ball knock which included four hits to the fence and three over it.</p> <p>&#8220;&#8230;it depended on the bowlers but (Mumbai Indians) batted well especially Rohit (Sharma) and later on Kieren Pollard, he batted well,&#8221; he said.</p> <p>On Kohli, de Villiers&#8217; dismissal in one over being the turning point, Abdulla said, &#8220;Yes, if your best batsman get out, who is making runs for your team, then it definitely, in a small way, costs the team&#8221;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2763419&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: Reuters) <p>Tottenham Hotspur&#8217;s clinical display in Monday&#8217;s 4-0 Premier League thrashing of Stoke City showed they are ready to take advantage of any slip up by leaders Leicester City, manager Mauricio Pochettino said.</p> <p>Second-placed Spurs cut the deficit with Leicester to five points after their latest win but with just four games remaining the North London club, who are looking to end their 55-year wait for a league title, are running out of time.</p> <p>Pochettino said his players need to believe there was still hope.</p> <p>&#8220;The most important thing is the performance we showed was perfect,&#8221; the Argentine told British media. &#8220;It is a big signal we are there waiting and fighting.</p> <p>&#8220;We need to believe that is possible. It is good for the competition that we are in behind to try and put pressure on Leicester. I feel very proud.</p> <p>&#8220;In football all can happen and, if Leicester fail, we need to be there. We need to try and reduce the gap. This is our dream.&#8221;</p> <p>Spurs host 14th-placed West Bromwich Albion at White Hart Lane on Monday, while Leicester take on 15th-placed Swansea City at the King Power Stadium a day earlier.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2760704&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

64 goals while conceding the least (25). (Source: Reuters) <p>Harry Kane backed up his cheeky pre-match warning to Premier League leaders Leicester City with two goals in <strong><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/tottenham-hotspur-hit-stoke-city-for-a-four-cut-leicester-citys-lead/">Tottenham Hotspur&#8217;s 4-0 thrashing of Stoke City</a></strong> on Monday.</p> <p>The England striker posted a photograph of a pride of lions closing in on their prey on Instagram after Leicester&#8217;s dramatic 2-2 draw with West Ham United on Sunday left the door ajar for second-placed Tottenham to close the gap to five points.</p> <p>It could have backfired had Tottenham failed to take advantage but Kane showed his killer instinct with his side&#8217;s first and third goals taking his league tally for the season to 24 &#8212; two more than Leicester&#8217;s hitman Jamie Vardy.</p> <p>&#8220;What a performance! Stoke is a tough place to come and to win in the manner we did shows what sort of team we are,&#8221; England striker Kane said.</p> <p>&#8220;We are not going anywhere. We are on the charge and we just have to keep doing what we&#8217;re doing. We scored four but could have had six or seven.&#8221;</p> <p>Asked about the photograph he posted, Kane added: &#8220;It was just a few lions waiting to pounce. After watching Leicester drop points I have been itching to play.</p> <p>&#8220;I had to wait a whole day and a half.&#8221;</p> <p>Kane curled his side ahead after nine minutes and put the result beyond doubt with a cool finish after 71.</p> <p>Dele Alli scored the other two, both superb finishes from Christian Eriksen assists, although the midfielder also provided a miss of the season candidate when he shot against the post after going round Stoke keeper Shay Given.</p> <p>Tottenham, dreaming of a first English title since 1961, have a league-leading 64 goals while conceding the least (25).</p> <p>They have been forced to play catch-up though with Leicester, and at one stage before they beat Manchester United 3-0 in their last game they trailed by 10 points.</p> <p>Manager Mauricio Pochettino was full of praise for the way his young side are responding to the challenge.</p> <p>&#8220;From the beginning we set out to win the game and we showed great quality and personality,&#8221; the Argentine said.</p> <p>&#8220;Today maybe I feel more proud because we had to play with the pressure to try to catch Leicester at the top which is not easy. But we&#8217;re hungry and showed passion in our play.</p> <p>&#8220;We are still fighting.&#8221;</p> <p>While Leicester remain in the driving seat for a surprise title, Tottenham look almost certain to join them in the Champions League next season having moved 12 points clear of fifth-placed Manchester United and eight ahead of Manchester City and Arsenal who are third and fourth.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2760026&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: Reuters) <p>Tottenham Hotspur took a large bite out of Leicester City&#8217;s Premier League lead with two goals apiece from Harry Kane and Dele Alli earning them a 4-0 victory at Stoke City on Monday.</p> <p>The visitors produced a scintillating display of attacking football to take full advantage of Leicester&#8217;s 2-2 home draw with West Ham United on Sunday and close the gap to five points with four matches remaining.</p> <p>Leicester remain favourites with 73 points but Tottenham&#8217;s fourth victory in five games, achieved with a real flourish, means the title race is back on the boil.</p> <p>&#8220;We are ready to put the pressure on Leicester. We think we can do it. Leicester are five points ahead but we have closed the gap, that&#8217;s all we could do,&#8221; Kane, who moved two goals clear of Leicester&#8217;s Jamie Vardy at the top of the scoring charts with 24 goals, said.</p> <p>&#8220;We scored four but could have had six or seven. It is one of our best performances all season. I was itching to play. I had to wait a whole day and a half.&#8221;</p> <p>England striker Kane gave Tottenham the perfect start after nine minutes, curling a textbook shot past keeper Shay Given after being played in by Moussa Dembele.</p> <p>Stoke briefly threatened a response and Hugo Lloris made a fine save from Marko Arnautovic but Tottenham should have gone further ahead when Alli played in Christian Eriksen but the Dane curled a shot against the crossbar with the goal gaping.</p> <p>More chances went begging early in the second half for Tottenham early in the second half but they doubled their lead after 67 minutes when Eriksen&#8217;s pass sent Alli clear and he calmly chipped Given.</p> <p>Incredibly Alli struck the post after rounding Given shortly afterwards, a comical miss that had Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino beating the turf in frustration, but it did not prove costly as Kane calmly converted Erik Lamela&#8217;s pull back after another rapid Spurs attack.</p> <p>Tottenham were running riot and completed the rout after 82 minutes with Eriksen again the provider, clipping a clever pass to the outstanding Alli who swept home a volley to condemn Stoke to their joint worst home defeat in the Premier League.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2759976&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

e in front of them, they have to win their last five games. (Source: Reuters) <p>Not even the most avid fans in Madrid could see this one coming.</p> <p>Thanks to an improbable collapse by a Barcelona team that looked unstoppable only a month ago, Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid are back in contention for the title.</p> <p>With five matches left, Atletico is even with the once-unbeatable Catalan club, and Real Madrid is only one point behind.</p> <p>&#8220;There&#8217;s still a lot of league left, we are thrilled,&#8221; Spanish league president Javier Tebas said Monday. &#8220;We said a few months ago that it wasn&#8217;t over yet.&#8221;</p> <p>None of the other top five leagues in Europe enter the final stretch of the season with the first three teams so close together.</p> <p>The Premier League has attracted a lot of attention thanks to Leicester&#8217;s amazing run. It holds a big lead over second-place Tottenham, and the difference to third-place Manchester City is already up to 13 points.</p> <p>Bayern Munich is seven points clear of Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga, and the difference to third-place Bayer Leverkusen is 27 points. In Italy, Juventus is nine points ahead of second-place Napoli and 14 points in front of Roma. Paris Saint-Germain cruised to the French league title with several matches to spare.</p> <p>It wasn&#8217;t always this close in Spain.</p> <p>Atletico was trailing by nine points last month, and Real Madrid was 12 points back. But while the Madrid teams kept winning, Barcelona imploded.</p> <p>The Catalan team lost three straight games to squander its comfortable lead in the Spanish league and was eliminated by Atletico Madrid in the Champions League quarterfinals, ending its chances of repeating the treble from a season ago.</p> <p>Its record streak of 39 unbeaten games was halted by a 2-1 loss to Real Madrid at the Camp Nou, and it hasn&#8217;t won in the league since a home match against last-place Getafe on March 12. Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar have failed to get the team back on track.</p> <p>&#8220;We have an incredible challenge in front of us, we have to win the last five games,&#8221; Barcelona coach Luis Enrique said. &#8220;We just have to get back up. We still depend on ourselves, but the cushion is over. If there&#8217;s one team that&#8217;s capable of picking itself up, it&#8217;s this Barcelona team.&#8221;</p> <p>Barcelona and Real Madrid have dominated in Spain recently, winning the league title 10 of the last 11 seasons. But Atletico has become a significant force in the past few years after the arrival of coach Diego Simeone, who instilled a team-first attitude and a fierce defensive scheme that allowed the club to become one of the most competitive in Spain and Europe.</p> <p>&#8220;You can compete for titles even if you don&#8217;t have the same financial power as some other clubs,&#8221; Tebas said. &#8220;Atletico Madrid has been showing this the last few years. With less than half of the revenue of the bigger clubs, it has been able to compete in the national level and in the Champions League.&#8221;</p> <p>Atletico won the 2014 title by finishing three points ahead of Barcelona and Real Madrid. Last year, Real Madrid finished two points behind Barcelona, with Atletico 16 points back.</p> <p>Atletico has three home games in the last five rounds, while Barcelona and Real Madrid play three away games.</p> <p>&#8220;It will be hard,&#8221; said Simeone, whose team has won seven of its last eight league matches. &#8220;We only have one option in our next games, which is to win, win and win.&#8221;</p> <p>All of Barcelona&#8217;s opponents are 13th or worse in the 20-team standings, while Atletico has to play at fifth-place Athletic Bilbao and against sixth-place Celta Vigo at home in the final match.</p> <p>Real Madrid, which has won seven in a row in the league and is also in the Champions League semifinals, still has to play against fourth-place Villarreal and 12th-place Valencia, and its final game is at Deportivo La Coruna.</p> <p>&#8220;We&#8217;re getting closer and closer to La Liga,&#8221; Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane said. &#8220;We know that if we&#8217;re going to achieve something, we have to believe we can do it. We have to keep going for it.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2759501&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: AP) <p>Newcastle United manager Rafael Benitez is hoping Manchester City&#8217;s players will be distracted by next week&#8217;s Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid when they face his relegation-threatened team on Tuesday.</p> <p>City, who are third in the Premier League after beating Chelsea 3-0 away on Saturday, take on a Newcastle side who are still languishing second from bottom despite a morale-boosting 3-0 home win over Swansea City at the weekend.</p> <p>City, through to the last four of the Champions League for the first time, host Real in the first leg on April 26, and Benitez suggested their players might try to save their legs for their big European night, giving Newcastle an edge.</p> <p>&#8220;In the back of your head you are thinking about a semi-final or a final and if you are going to get an injury,&#8221; the Spaniard told reporters on Monday.</p> <p>&#8220;They are professionals and they will try to win but in the back of their mind they won&#8217;t want to miss a game through injury. I think they have an eye on the Champions League and hopefully we can take advantage.&#8221;</p> <p>However, City also need points to make sure they finish in the top four and guaranteee a Champions League spot, with Arsenal level on points with them in fourth and fifth-placed Manchester United four points behind with five games left.</p> <p>Benitez confirmed he would still be without injured captain Fabricio Coloccini, who has not played since February, while defender Darryl Janmaat, who missed the Swansea game with groin and hand injuries, has also not yet recovered.</p> <p>Newcastle are three points from the safety zone and two behind north-east rivals Sunderland but with a gamne in hand over fourth-bottom Norwich City.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2759361&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: Reuters) <p>Luis Figo and Carles Puyol find it inexplicable, while Raul thinks it&#8217;s a testament to the quality of Spanish football but all three La Liga legends are sure that Barcelona&#8217;s astonishing slump would not last too long.</p> <p>Speaking at what was described as the &#8216;Football Press Conference&#8217; at the Laureus World Sports Awards, the trio was inundated by questions on Barcelona&#8217;s disastrous run in the past one week.</p> <p>The Spanish giants have lost four of their last six games, winning just one and drawing another.</p> <p>Add to this, they have been knocked out of the Champions League after losing in the quarterfinals.</p> <p>&#8220;There are a lot of dynamics to football. Losing always hurts but they will come back stronger and that will be interesting,&#8221; said former Barcelona captain Puyol.</p> <p>Barcelona are still at the top of the table in Spanish league but only on goal difference against Atletico Madrid.</p> <p>The latest setback to the team came on Sunday night when it went down 1-2 to Valencia.</p> <p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t really compare the three teams in the top half right now. That&#8217;s why I say, La Liga is the best. Because of this (Barcelona&#8217;s slump), the race to the title has become more interesting and I am enjoying it. They are all good teams,&#8221; said Real Madrid great and former Spain captain Raul.</p> <p>Figo, who played for both Barcelona and Real Madrid during his career, more or less echoed the view.</p> <p>&#8220;It is not normal for Barcelona to lose so many matches. I agree the league is more open now. As for Barcelona, I can&#8217;t explain what&#8217;s happening with them. It is certainly not a question of talent. But I am sure they are going to come back,&#8221; he said.</p> <p>&#8220;May be they need a captain like Puyol to bring them back,&#8221; he added laughingly.</p> <p>The players were also asked about their favourites for the Champions League final.</p> <p>While Raul wanted an all-Spanish contest between Real and Atletico, Figo felt a Real vs Bayern Munich match would be perfect for him.</p> <p>Also there at the event was Brazil&#8217;s World Cup winning former captain Cafu, who gave his vote to a Manchester City-Atletico contest.</p> <p>&#8220;No matter who makes it, I am sure it is going to be a fantastic final,&#8221; said Figo.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2759378&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: Reuters) <p>Manchester City&#8217;s Premier League title challenge derailed once the club announced Pep Guardiola would take charge from next season, outgoing manager Manuel Pellegrini has said.</p> <p>City won just three of their next 11 games to fall behind in the title race and exit the FA Cup once the announcement was made in February about the Bayern Munich boss.</p> <p>&#8220;At the start of February, there was news about a change of the manager, about players who will not continue here next season, about a lot of things involved in the minds of all the players,&#8221; Pellegrini told British media.</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not easy for the players when you read in newspapers all things that will happen next season, all the players who will go out, all the players that will come in.<br /> It&#8217;s not easy for the players to focus their mind.</p> <p>&#8220;In February we were involved in all the competitions, in the Champions League, we won the Capital One (League) Cup, we were forced to leave the FA Cup, and we were three points behind the leaders.&#8221;</p> <p>Third-placed City, 13 points behind leaders Leicester City, have since picked up from the dip and are unbeaten in their last five games, winning 3-0 at Chelsea on Saturday.</p> <p>They have also progressed to the Champions League semi-finals for the first time and will take on Real Madrid.</p> <p>Pellegrini put the change in form down to the players&#8217; increased concentration levels ahead of their trip to relegation-threatened Newcastle United on Tuesday.</p> <p>&#8220;We must try to finish now playing this way, trying to be as near as possible at the top of the table, trying to reach the final of the Champions League and we will finish a good season if we win two titles,&#8221; the Chilean said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2759117&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

hind Arsenal. (Source: Reuters) <p>Striker Andy Carroll has accused referee Jonathan Moss of trying to even things up with some &#8220;bad decisions&#8221; in Sunday&#8217;s Premier League draw with 10-men Leicester City that harmed their Champions League qualifying hopes.</p> <p>West Ham led 2-1 deep into injury time at the King Power Stadium but Moss awarded a penalty in the 94th minute after Carroll had brought down Jeffrey Schlupp in the area. Leonardo Ulloa converted from the spot to snatch a point.</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not acceptable. Week in, week out, we&#8217;ve had bad decisions. I mean, it is a bad decision. It&#8217;s not the first time and probably won&#8217;t be the last,&#8221; Carroll told British media.</p> <p><strong>READ: <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/leicester-city-minus-jamie-vardy-salvage-2-2-draw-west-ham-2757921/">Leicester City, minus Jamie Vardy, salvage 2-2 draw with West Ham United</a></strong></p> <p>&#8220;I think he&#8217;s trying to even it up&#8230; We could be third and flying. Now we&#8217;re still fighting for fourth, fifth spot and we&#8217;re slipping down by losing these points. It is just disappointing and there&#8217;s nothing we can do about it.&#8221;</p> <p>Moss had earlier penalised Leicester&#8217;s Wes Morgan for a pull back on Winston Reid, which allowed Carroll to convert from the spot to make it 1-1 before a stunning strike from full back Aaron Creswell put the visitors ahead.</p> <p>The draw left sixth-placed West Ham seven points behind Arsenal, who are fourth and hold the final Champions League qualifying spot, with five games left.</p> <p>Slaven Bilic&#8217;s men host 12th-placed Watford at Upton Park on Wednesday.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2758828&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

<img class="size-full wp-image-2758823" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/mauricio-pochettino-m.jpg" alt="Mauricio Pochettino" /> Second-placed Tottenham have only five games to overhaul the eight point gap on Leicester. (Source: AP) <p>Tottenham Hotspur players should each be immortalised outside White Hart Lane if they were to end the north London club&#8217;s 55-year wait for an English league title, manager Mauricio Pochettino has said.</p> <p>Spurs have the opportunity to reduce the gap on leaders Leicester City to five points when they travel to Stoke City on Monday after Claudio Ranieri&#8217;s men could only manage a draw against West Ham United in the Premier League on Sunday.</p> <p>&#8220;If we won the championship, I think that every player would deserve a statue. The challenge is big because it is a big gap,&#8221; Pochettino told British media.</p> <p>&#8220;But to keep fighting in the way that we have fought and in the end win the title, all the people would recognise our value. And we would be happy, too.&#8221;</p> <p>Second-placed Tottenham have only five games to overhaul the eight point gap on Leicester but Pochettino said he would not give up hope.</p> <p>&#8220;I am a very positive person in my life, I always believe that things can happen, good things for us,&#8221; the Argentine said.</p> <p>&#8220;I never wish for bad things for them but I want them to drop points&#8230; In football, anything can happen. One thing can change things. We are in love with football because it is not predictable.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2758772&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

men are still fourth in the table. (Source: Reuters) <p>Arsene Wenger wants his side to repair the &#8220;mental damage&#8221; of a 1-1 draw against Crystal Palace when they face West Bromwich Albion in the Premier League on Thursday.</p> <p>The Gunners blew a chance to take a major step towards securing Champions League qualification for a remarkable 19th successive season after being held at home by London rivals Palace at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.</p> <p>Arsenal led via Alexis Sanchez&#8217;s header in first-half stoppage time and dominated throughout before Yannick Bolasie&#8217;s equaliser in the 81st minute ensured the home side were greeted with a chorus of boos come the final whistle.</p> <p>Wenger&#8217;s men are still fourth in the table, occupying the last of the automatic Champions League places on offer to English clubs, but Manchester United are just four points behind in fifth with five games remaining.</p> <p>Sunday&#8217;s result ended Arsenal&#8217;s already-slim hopes of winning the title and veteran Gunners boss Wenger said: &#8220;We are too disappointed to think about the league, we have to think about the Champions League and fight to be in the Champions League.</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not in that kind of mood to dream about the championship but I need to repair mental damage and prepare for the next game to come against West Brom on Thursday,&#8221; the Frenchman added. &#8220;You have to do that rather than look behind us.</p> <p>&#8220;Everyone playing is winning games. It could be a fight in the end to stay and get a place in the top four.&#8221;</p> <p>Against Palace, it was a familiarly depressing story for Arsenal, who dominated but still dropped two points.</p> <p>Sanchez headed home Danny Welbeck&#8217;s pass on the strike of half-time against a Palace side content to sit back and defend deep.<br /> But chances went begging for Arsenal before Bolasie hit the hosts on the break nine minutes from time.</p> <p>&#8220;We usually create a high number of chances. We lacked a change of pace, sharpness and they defended well,&#8221; Wenger said.</p> <p>&#8220;You have to sometime win 1-0 and this one of those days. We are a team that likes to take the initiative. With that you expect goals and you accept the risk where taking the game to an opponent.</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m responsible and I&#8217;m frustrated. We will see where we stand at the end of the season so we must stick together.&#8221;</p> <p>Palace are all but safe from the threat of relegation and manager Alan Pardew now hopes his players give him a selection dilemma at Manchester United on Wednesday before Saturday&#8217;s FA Cup semi-final with Watford.</p> <p>&#8220;There will be changes,&#8221; Pardew said. &#8220;I want to give people the chance to play in that semi-final.</p> <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think (losing focus) will be a problem at Old Trafford. There&#8217;s more energy in the team and a defensive focus. They are a great bunch of players to manage. We are an honest team.</p> <p>&#8220;That period before our recent game with West Ham and I think the Cup run was affecting our focus, work rate, commitment &#8212; and that&#8217;s what Palace is about.</p> <p>&#8220;We have renewed confidence in our defence and goalkeeper (Wayne Hennessey). We need momentum to go to big game likes<br /> Old Trafford and Wembley.&#8221;</p> <p>Pardew added: &#8220;We are a mid-table team and we need to prove that. We need to get ourselves up there and there&#8217;s this big game for the club and our fans at Wembley.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2758667&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: Reuters) <p>Barcelona&#8217;s stuttering title bid suffered another setback when they lost 2-1 at home to Valencia as they registered a third straight La Liga defeat for the first time since 2003.</p> <p>Luis Enrique&#8217;s shell-shocked side are level on 76 points with Atletico Madrid, who knocked the holders out of the Champions League in midweek, and remain top only due to a superior head-to-head record.</p> <p>An own goal by Ivan Rakitic put Valencia ahead after 27 minutes and Santi Mina added a second just before halftime to stun the Barca supporters at the Nou Camp.</p> <p>Lionel Messi scored his 500th career goal to reduce the deficit after 64 minutes but the struggling hosts, who have squandered a nine-point lead, could not find an equaliser.</p> <p>Valencia goalkeeper Diego Alves produced a spectacular save to deny Rakitic late on and Gerard Pique agonisingly missed the target at the near post in stoppage time.</p> <p>Earlier, Atletico Madrid eased to a 3-0 home win over struggling Granada to go level with Barcelona on points after Fernando Torres grabbed his fourth goal in as many games.</p> <p>Spain international Koke opened the scoring after 15 minutes and then teed up Torres for the second in the 59th, while substitute Angel Correa rounded off the victory in the 83rd.</p> <p>Atletico, boosted by a 2-0 win over Barca on Wednesday which put them into the Champions League semi-finals, started brightly with Koke blazing over the bar moments after kick-off.</p> <p>The midfielder proved more accurate minutes later, pouncing on a loose ball after Torres&#8217;s effort was blocked and drilling a shot into the net.</p> <p>Granada winger Ruben Rochina hit the post later in the half before Torres eased Atletico&#8217;s nerves by notching the second, latching onto a threaded pass by Koke to lift the ball over goalkeeper Andres Fernandez and into the far corner.</p> <p>Argentine forward Correa came on to replace Atletico&#8217;s top scorer Antoine Griezmann and made the most of his cameo appearance by racing onto a pass from Saul Niguez down the left and tucking the ball into the far bottom corner.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2758136&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: Reuters) <p>Arsenal had to settle for a 1-1 draw at home to Crystal Palace after Yannick Bolasie struck a late goal in their Premier League clash on Sunday to leave Arsene Wenger&#8217;s side looking over their shoulders in the race for a top four place.</p> <p>Alexis Sanchez put the hosts ahead when he nodded home Danny Welbeck&#8217;s delightful dinked ball just before halftime but Bolasie equalised with a low drive from the edge of area that beat Petr Cech at his near post in the 82nd minute.</p> <p>Arsenal dominated possession with Sanchez and Mesut Ozil close to scoring from free kicks, while the Germany midfielder was denied from point-blank range by visiting goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey just before the Chile forward opened the scoring.</p> <p>Bolasie&#8217;s leveller shook the fourth-placed home side and they were almost caught out again in stoppage time when only a last-ditch tackle from Gabriel Paulista stopped dangerous winger Wilfried Zaha in his tracks as he burst into the area.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2758018&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

<img class="wp-image-2758020 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/i-league-_pti-m.jpg" alt="" /> Bengaluru FC players celebrate their I-League title win after beating Salgaocar FC 2-0. (Source: PTI) <p>Bengaluru FC were crowned as I-League football champions for the second time in three years as they blanked Salgaocar 2-0 in their penultimate league match on Sunday.</p> <p>Eugenson Lyngdoh (8th minute) and Seminlen Doungel (87th) scored for Bengaluru as Ashley Westwood-coached side took full three points to clinch their second I-League title in front of their home crowd at the Kanteerava Stadium.</p> <p>They had won their maiden crown in 2013-14 season and had finished second last season (2014-15) behind Mohun Bagan.</p> <p>With 32 points from 15 matches, Bengaluru took an unassailable five point lead from currently second-placed Mohun Bagan (27 points from 15 matches) with one match to spare.</p> <p>This means that their last league fixture against Mohun Bagan on April 23 in Siliguri has been rendered inconsequential as far as I-League title is concerned.</p> <p>But that match will have importance for deciding the second-place finisher as East Bengal (25 points from 15 matches) are currently at third just two points behind Mohun Bagan.</p> <p>East Bengal can finish at second if they beat Shillong Lajong in their last match on April 24 in Shillong and Mohun Bagan lose against Bengaluru.</p> <p>Seeking to clinch the title today itself, Westwood fielded the first choice eleven for the clash with Curtis Osano and John Johnson returning to the fold as centre halves with Eugeneson Lyngdoh and Michael Collins manning the midfield.</p> <p>Youngster Malsawmzuala got a start with Udanta Singh as the wingmen. Skipper Sunil Chhetri combined with Korean Kim Seong Yong to form the attacking nucleus of the &#8216;Blues&#8217;.</p> <p>It took just eight minutes for Bengaluru FC to open the scoring through Eugeneson Lyngdoh. The India midfielder scored his third goal in his comeback from injury as he latched onto a loose ball from Salgaocar goalkeeper Karanjit Singh&#8217;s punch off a cross from the left.</p> <p>Unmarked 25 yards out, Lyngdoh drove it straight across the ground with a right footer to take the early lead and leave the Goans fluttered.</p> <p>Salgaocar tried to make a comeback as Jackichand Singh made his way past a couple of defenders but Amrinder Singh was quick to get onto the ball. Thangjam Saran Singh was booked after he brought down Udanta Singh during a Lyngdoh freekick and Salgaocar never really pressed after that during the first half.</p> <p>Kim Seong Yong could have added the second goal for Bengaluru but was blocked by Leny Pereira and on the second attempt off it, Eder did well to deny Sunil Chhetri from close range.</p> <p>Six minutes past the half hour mark, Salgaocar keeper Karanjit pulled off fine save, diving to his left to deny Michael Collins.</p> <p>After some lighting related interruption, the second half started with Salgaocar tried to break the resolute Bengaluru defense but were unable to create much of an impact with their attempts.</p> <p>Skipper Chhetri set up the second goal for Bengaluru which sealed the title three minutes from time. After a fine move at the left channel, Chhetri squared the ball into the box and with Salgaocar keeper Karanjit out of his line, substitute Seminlen Doungel was there to calmly dab the ball into the open net.</p> <p>The Kanteerava crowd erupted to wild cheers as the referee blew the whistle.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2758017&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: Reuters) <p>Leicester forward Leonardo Ulloa scored a penalty in the fifth minute of stoppage time to rescue a 2-2 draw for the Premier League leaders against West Ham after top-scorer Jamie Vardy was sent off on Sunday.</p> <p>And by avoiding a first loss in two months, Leicester extended its lead to eight points ahead of second-place Tottenham playing at Stoke on Monday.</p> <p>&#8220;We showed again our team spirit and togetherness,&#8221; Leicester defender Danny Simpson said. &#8220;We know we always fight to the death and that&#8217;s what we did.&#8221;</p> <p>Leicester had been on a serene march to a first league title in its 132-year history until this game of divisive refereeing and late drama.</p> <p>The result swung on three penalty calls, with the first not given by referee Jonathan Moss in the 54th minute when Vardy was adjudged to have dived and the striker was shown a second yellow card.</p> <p>Vardy had already contributed his 22nd goal of the campaign in the first half. Leicester clung on for more than 30 minutes to protect its lead until the 84th minute when Andy Carroll netted from the spot after home captain Wes Morgan shoved Winston Reid over.</p> <p>It was the first goal Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel had conceded in 574 minutes and he was beaten again two minutes later. Aaron Cresswell appeared to have ended Leicester&#8217;s seven-match unbeaten streak when he put sixth-place West Ham in front by striking into the top corner.</p> <p>But deep in stoppage time came a lifeline for Leicester when Moss this time awarded the hosts a penalty. Carroll shoved Jeffrey Schlupp off the ball and substitute Ulloa converted from the spot for his fourth goal of the season.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2757921&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: Reuters) <p>England manager Roy Hodgson has played down West Ham United striker Andy Carroll&#8217;s chances of being picked for this year&#8217;s European Championships.</p> <p>The injury-plagued 27-year-old scored a Premier League hat-trick against Arsenal last week, prompting calls for Hodgson to include him in the squad for the tournament in France, which starts in June.</p> <p>&#8220;Every time someone scores a goal and he&#8217;s English it is &#8216;why is he not playing for England?&#8217;,&#8221; the 68-year-old told reporters.</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m certainly not going to pick him on the basis that he scored a hat-trick so therefore has to be in the England team.&#8221;</p> <p>Carroll&#8217;s main strengths are his physical presence and ability in the air, offering a different threat to Hodgson&#8217;s other forward options including Harry Kane, Jamie Vardy, Daniel Sturridge, Danny Welbeck and Wayne Rooney.</p> <p>&#8220;We know Andy, we know his qualities,&#8221; Hodgson said.</p> <p>&#8220;In an ideal world, if you had a lot of places at your disposal, you&#8217;d always include a guy like him because he is exceptional in the air &#8211; but whether or not I&#8217;d be able to include him with all these others, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p> <p>Carroll won the last of his nine England caps in 2012.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2757763&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

Lescott. (Source: Reuters) <p>Former Aston Villa striker Stan Collymore has lashed out at Jolean Lescott after the defender said their relegation from the Premier League was a &#8220;weight off the shoulders.&#8221;</p> <p>Villa, European Cup winners in the 1981/82 season, lost 1-0 to Manchester United at Old Trafford on Saturday to confirm demotion following a disastrous campaign in which they have won just three matches and employed the same number of managers.</p> <p>Lescott has endured a tough time since signing from West Bromwich Albion in September but the 33-year-old said he wanted to stay on with the seven-times English champions.</p> <p>&#8220;We showed a level of pride that there&#8217;s probably not been enough of throughout the season,&#8221; the central defender, capped 26 times by England, told the BBC after Saturday&#8217;s loss.</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about results so regardless of how we played in patches today we are relegated &#8230; but now it&#8217;s confirmed maybe it&#8217;s a weight off the shoulders and we can give these fans what they deserve, some performances.</p> <p>&#8220;Throughout the season we have given reasons for people to jump on us. It&#8217;s part of football, we have to take that on the chin. It&#8217;s a tough time at the minute. But at the back of our minds is next season to get promoted. I&#8217;m here for as long as Aston Villa want me.&#8221;</p> <p>Lescott had angered Villa fans by posting a picture of a sports car on Twitter after a 6-0 home loss to Liverpool in February which he later said was published accidentally from his pocket while he was driving.</p> <p>Collymore, who spent three years at Villa now works as a commentator and presenter on radio station TalkSPORT, said relegation should not be regarded as a relief and that people would lose their jobs at the club.</p> <p>&#8220;Today this is a senior international footballer in the modern era, now confirmed &#8216;maybe it&#8217;s a weight off the shoulders.&#8217; Why is it a weight off the shoulders Joleon?&#8221; Collymore said on a radio programme.</p> <p>&#8220;It should hang on your shoulders.</p> <p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the Villa staff, there&#8217;s real weight on their shoulders, people are getting made redundant, that have been there 20 years, that don&#8217;t know where the next pay cheque is going to come from.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2757344&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

Hat-trick, Football" /> Sergio Aguero&#8217;s hat-trick took his tally to 21 league goals for the season. (Source: AP) <p>Sergio Aguero scored a hat-trick as Manchester City capped an excellent week by beating 10-man Chelsea 3-0 at Stamford Bridge to move ahead of Arsenal and into third place in the Premier League.</p> <p>City, who beat Paris St Germain to reach the Champions League semi-finals on Tuesday, deservedly took the lead in the 32nd minute when Aguero got on the end of a slick move prompted by Kevin De Bruyne.</p> <p>The former Chelsea midfielder was equally influential after the break, starting the attack which led to Aguero&#8217;s second in the 54th minute.</p> <p>Aguero then rounded off the comfortable win from the penalty spot after Thibaut Courtois brought down Fernandinho, a challenge for which the Belgian keeper was dismissed in the 78th minute.</p> <p>The Argentine&#8217;s hat-trick took his tally to 21 league goals for the season.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2756893&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: AP) <p>Real Madrid moved to within a point of La Liga leaders Barcelona after Karim Benzema, Isco, Gareth Bale, James Rodriguez and Cristiano Ronaldo all scored in a 5-1 thrashing at struggling Getafe on Saturday.</p> <p>Benzema opened the scoring after 29 minutes by tapping home from close range and then laid on the pass for Isco to double the lead in the 40th.</p> <p>Bale got the third five minutes after the restart, taking his league tally to 16 goals this season, his best since moving to Madrid in 2013.</p> <p>Pablo Sarabia pulled one back for Getafe in the 84th when he curled the ball into the top corner from the edge of the area, but Rodriguez added another for Madrid, before Ronaldo tapped in with the final kick of the game.</p> <p>Madrid have 75 points and provisionally move ahead of city rivals Atletico, who play Granada on Sunday, when Barcelona host Valencia.</p> <p>Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane said in February that the title race was over, but after watching his side outclass Getafe he was far more optimistic about their chances.</p> <p>&#8220;I think we have a better chance of winning the league because we keep on getting closer,&#8221; Zidane told reporters.</p> <p>&#8220;We believe it&#8217;s possible and against Getafe we showed from the start that we wanted to do everything right. We played a fantastic game, but now we have to keep going because we still haven&#8217;t achieved anything.&#8221;</p> <p>Benzema put them ahead, volleying Rodriguez&#8217;s cross into the bottom corner for his 22nd league goal of the season, which surpassed his previous record of 21 goals in the 2011/12 campaign.</p> <p>The Frenchman, who learned this week that he would not be going to the European Championships with France due to his alleged involvement in a blackmail scandal, played a one-two with Isco to allow the Spanish midfielder to get the second.</p> <p>Bale grabbed his goal by racing into the area from the right and curling the ball left-footed into the far corner.</p> <p>Sarabia&#8217;s strike was Getafe&#8217;s first goal under new coach Juan Esnaider, who replaced Fran Escriba this week.</p> <p>James scored after dazzling a Getafe defender, and substitute Jese set up Ronaldo to tap in the fifth in stoppage time.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2756802&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: Reuters) <p>Aston Villa was relegated from the English Premier League for the first time since 1987 after losing to Manchester United 1-0 on Saturday.</p> <p>Marcus Rashford slotted home from Antonio Valencia&#8217;s cross in the 32nd minute.</p> <p>Although the Midlands club was effectively relegated for some time, the result finally ended Villa&#8217;s ever-present status in the Premier League since its inception in 1992. Villa has lost nine games in a row, and a highly uninspiring performance against Man United typified the disappointing performances that have wrecked its season.</p> <p>United remained fifth, provisionally one point behind rival Manchester City, which played Chelsea late.</p> <p>Aston Villa is the fifth most successful team in English history, having won the first division and English FA Cup seven times each. It also won the 1982 European Cup. Just five years ago, Villa was challenging for European places.</p> <p>Its demise was inevitable for much of the season, having won just three times, and rarely showing any quality. This week, the club cancelled its player of the year awards.</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a mood of disappointment,&#8221; caretaker manager Eric Black said. &#8220;There are players in there capable of playing in the Championship.&#8221;</p> <p>Villa holds the worst scoring and defense records in the league, with just 23 goals in 34 games.</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s part of football, we have to take that on the chin. It&#8217;s a tough time at the minute,&#8221; Villa defender Joleon Lescott said. &#8220;Now it&#8217;s confirmed, maybe it&#8217;s a weight off the shoulders and we can give these fans what they deserve, some performances.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2756789&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

<img class="wp-image-2756618 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/barcelona_reuters-m.jpg" alt="" /> Barcelona have lost three of their last four matches since returning from the international break. (Source: Reuters) <p>Barcelona are still the best side in La Liga despite their poor recent form, coach Luis Enrique said on Saturday.</p> <p>The leaders have not won any of their last three La Liga games and on Wednesday were eliminated from the Champions League by Atletico Madrid, ending hopes of an unprecedented two successive trebles.</p> <p>&#8220;There is no team that has been better than Barca. I wouldn&#8217;t swap with any other team in the league,&#8221; Luis Enrique told a news conference ahead of Sunday&#8217;s home match with Valencia.</p> <p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t gone into hiding. We said we were the favourites to win every competition, another thing is whether we deserve to win them.&#8221;</p> <p>Luis Enrique&#8217;s focus is now on securing a La Liga-King&#8217;s Cup double.</p> <p>Barca have lost three of their last four matches since returning from the international break, before which they had gone 39 games undefeated in all competitions, but Luis Enrique did not offer an explanation for his team&#8217;s sudden slump.</p> <p>&#8220;Everyone wants to talk about the negatives but, I&#8217;m sorry, for me it&#8217;s in the past,&#8221; he said.</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not down to one thing, there&#8217;s an infinite number of factors that determine whether a team wins or loses.</p> <p>&#8220;We have dealt with the defeat with the utmost dignity. It&#8217;s risky to make conclusions with six games and a cup final to play (against Sevilla next month).&#8221;</p> <p>Luis Enrique declined to say whether the club were planning to punish Dani Alves for posting an Instagram video after the defeat by Atletico where the defender imitated his girlfriend, wore a wig and said, &#8220;It&#8217;s only a football match, it doesn&#8217;t matter&#8221;.</p> <p>&#8220;Our decision will be kept a secret, we don&#8217;t want to air our dirty laundry in public,&#8221; said the coach.</p> <p>We all know Dani Alves and his activity on social media, we have seen him do everything. Each person can decide for themselves whether it&#8217;s opportune.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2756597&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: Reuters) <p>Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter told AFP Friday he &#8220;is available&#8221; to appear as a witness at a United States trial into mass corruption at world football&#8217;s ruling body.</p> <p>&#8220;Yes. When they need me to defend FIFA, I will be available,&#8221; Blatter said, when asked if he would be prepared to attend the trial into the sweeping bribery scandal that has sparked an unprecedented crisis at the top of the game.</p> <p>US prosecutors were hoping the hearing of 39 officials and marketing executives accused of soliciting and receiving tens of millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks would begin in February 2017.</p> <p>But on Thursday, the US judge overseeing the corruption scandal postponed setting a trial date until after prosecutors share the bulk of evidence being collated in the massive investigation.</p> <p>Blatter, with suspended European football chief Michel Platini, was banned from all football activities for eight years in December over an infamous two million Swiss franc ($2 million, 1.8 million euro) payment Platini received in 2011 from the then-FIFA president.</p> <p>The suspensions were cut to six years in February.</p> <p>Blatter, since replaced as FIFA president by Gianni Infantino, is awaiting a date for an appeal against his ban to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).</p> <p>Platini was told earlier Friday his CAS appeal will be heard on April 29.</p> <p>Blatter, attending a debate on FIFA reforms at Basel University, commented:&#8221;It&#8217;s good news that CAS has made progress with Platini&#8217;s case. I think my case will be handled shortly after.&#8221;</p> <p>The 80-year-old Swiss added:&#8221;I believe that now, finally, at CAS, they are going to talk about justice, and not just speculation. That means it&#8217;s justice that will prove if the accused is guilty and not the accused who has to prove his innocence.&#8221;</p> <p>He says his appeal is based on the principle that &#8220;the Blatters pay their debts&#8221;.</p> <p>He explained: &#8220;There was a contract between the FIFA president and Platini, an oral contract and then indeed a written one.</p> <p>&#8220;And so I paid the debt, generally when you pay a debt you are thanked. But in this case because I paid the debt I&#8217;m punished. According to the principles instilled in me by my father who for me was a paragon of virtue, &#8216; we, Blatters, pay our debts&#8217;. And that&#8217;s also the principle that we adhere to at FIFA.&#8221;</p> <p>He made clear that should CAS reject his appeal, he will not give up trying to clear his name.</p> <p>&#8220;There are other ways to get the ban lifted,&#8221; he suggested, saying he could take his case to Swiss justice, or take out a civil action.</p> <p>&#8220;But for me I&#8217;m confident CAS will overturn the decision,&#8221; he stated.</p> <p>Irrespective of the outcome of his CAS hearing, Blatter plans to attend the 2018 World Cup finals in Russia as a guest of Russian President Vladimir Putin, although if he were to attend a match he would be flouting the terms of his suspension.</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got an invitation to go to Russia,&#8221; he said.</p> <p>&#8220;I will go Russia. Going to Russia doesn&#8217;t mean that I&#8217;m going to watch games. They can&#8217;t stop me travelling. I go where I want to.&#8221;</p> <p>He refused to pass comment on his successor Infantino&#8217;s performance since taking over the top job in football in February.</p> <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have a verdict. I don&#8217;t even know his programme and I&#8217;m letting him get on with it.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2755994&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: Reuters) <p>Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane says Frenchman Karim Benzema is &#8220;distraught&#8221; about being left out of the squad for this year&#8217;s European Championship, the only major tournament to be played in his home country during his career.</p> <p>The 28-year-old Real striker, at the peak of his game, was told on Wednesday that he would not be included in the squad because of his alleged involvement in a blackmail scandal.</p> <p>Former France captain Zidane would not comment on the French Federation&#8217;s decision at a news conference on Friday.</p> <p>&#8220;I spoke to Karim about it after they made a decision not to call him up, I&#8217;m not going to speak much about that because it&#8217;s not my place, all I can say is the player is upset and distraught, he wanted to be there,&#8221; Zidane said.</p> <p>&#8220;We all know what a player he is and what he can contribute. On a sporting level everyone who loves football will be disappointed, but I told him he will have an exciting end to the season,&#8221; said Zidane, who was part of the France team that won the 1998 World Cup on home soil.</p> <p>Real will play Manchester City in the Champions League semi-finals and are third in La Liga, four points behind leaders Barcelona.</p> <p>They travel to struggling Getafe on Saturday hoping to put pressure on stuttering leaders Barca, who have lost three of their last four matches in all competitions.</p> <p>Getafe have not won a league game since Jan. 17 and are 19th in the table. They replaced coach Fran Escriba with Juan Esnaider this week.</p> <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like the atmosphere around the Getafe game at all,&#8221; Zidane said.</p> <p>&#8220;It seems that we&#8217;re going to win easily at Getafe but it&#8217;s not like that, it won&#8217;t be easy at all against a team playing for their lives.<br /> They have a new coach who I know, it&#8217;s going to be difficult, we have to play first tomorrow and play well so we don&#8217;t get a surprise.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2755514&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

Liverpool's comeback win over Borussia Dortmund after being 0-2 and 1-3 down at Anfield in the Europa League is not a rarity.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2755372&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

ool milan champions league, liverpool champions league, football" /> Liverpool stunned Borussia Dortmund with their amazing come-from-behind 4-3 win. (Source: Reuters) <p>Jurgen Klopp&#8217;s men may have stunned Borussia Dortmund with their amazing come-from-behind 4-3 win on Thursday night, but for the Anfield faithful, victory snatched from the jaws of defeat and/or winner in the last minute is a regular on the menu.</p> <p><strong>READ: <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/liverpool-create-special-moment-at-anfield-2754552/">Liverpool create &#8216;special moment&#8217; at Anfield</a></strong></p> <p>While every club out there has its share of victories against all odds or with the final kick of a match, few have made as regular a habit of it as the Red side of Merseyside. The Dortmund Heist, which might have stopped a few hearts in other places, was almost expected at Liverpool. If that sounds a bit much, then consider the following amazing wins conjured out of seeming thin air by the Reds:</p> <p><strong>1910: Old Trafford gets a rousing debut</strong></p> <p>Yes, you read that year right. It was more than a hundred years ago when Manchester United first played a match on their now legendary home turf of Old Trafford. And their opponents were Liverpool. The clash between the two clubs, who were already bitter rivals (yes, the Reds rivalry goes THAT far back), turned out to be an absolute humdinger. Manchester United got off to a terrific start, going up 3-0 through goals by Sandy Turnbull, Tom Homer and George Wall, only for the visitors to silence most part of a massive 45,000 crowd by storming back through a  brace from Arthur Goddard and James Stewart. Liverpool had won the first match played by their arch rivals on their famous home turf 4-3, and many believe that the legend of Liverpool making dramatic comebacks was born that February day in 1910.</p> <p><strong>1989: The Extra Time Cup Final!</strong></p> <p>The 1989 FA Cup final was played under the shadow of the Hillsborough tragedy in which 96 fans lost their lives in a stampede. So sombre was the mood that even though the match featured local rivals Liverpool and Everton, the usual bite and banter was replaced by a commitment to play their best. And play their best the two teams did. Liverpool went ahead with a goal by John Aldridge in the fourth minute and seemed to be coasting to a win when Everton equalised with a minute left in the match. It rained goals in extra time. Ian Rush gave Liverpool the lead, only for McCall to equalise again. But barely had the Everton cheers died out than Rush scored again to give Liverpool a late, but well-deserved win.</p> [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7YDXFaKCkY&amp;w=640&amp;h=390] <p><strong>1996: The Greatest EPL Game Ever?</strong></p> <p>In terms of sheer quality of football, there are many who consider the clash on 3 April 1996, between Liverpool and Newcastle to be the best ever in Premier League history. The match was marked by near reckless end to end attack by two teams that seemed to know how to score and had little idea of defence. Newcastle (who were ironically coached by former Liverpool legend Kevin Keegan) went into the match as firm favourites, being one of the EPL title frontrunners, but it was Liverpool who took the lead with Robbie Fowler scoring within two minutes of the match starting. Twelve minutes later, Newcastle were in front with goals from Ferdinand and Ginola. Fowler got Liverpool level in the 55th minute, only for Aspirilla to put Newcastle 3-2 up two minutes later. And then Stan Collymore turned it on for the Reds, scoring an equaliser in the 68th minute and then smashing in the winner in added time, leaving a stunned Kevin Keegan slumped over an advertising hoarding. Newcastle lost the title race to Manchester United and it is felt that Collymore&#8217;s brace towards the end started the end of the Keegan era at the club.</p> [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwCDYc-r3iI&amp;w=640&amp;h=390] <p><strong>2001: THAT Free Kick that won the Derby</strong></p> <p>There have been many last minute goals in the EPL, but perhaps not too many are as famous or as spectacular as the one that Liverpool&#8217;s Gary McAllister scored to win Liverpool the Merseyside Derby against local rivals, Everton. The matches between Liverpool and Everton have always been bitter affairs because both clubs come from the same region and the 2001 match was a particularly hot-tempered one. The referee handed out a dozen yellow cards and sent off Liverpool&#8217;s Igor Biscan, and both teams got a penalty each. Twice Liverpool took the lead through Emile Heskey and Dietmar Hamann, twice Everton restored parity with goals from Ferguson and Unsworth. In the middle of all this, the man many called &#8216;God,&#8217; Robbie Fowler, actually missed a penalty. The match seemed to be drifting towards a draw when Liverpool won a free-kick more than forty yards from the Everton goal, well into injury time. It was the sort of distance from which trying to score would have been outrageous. Nobody had told Gary McAllister that. The veteran midfielder ran up to the ball and thumped a stunning shot that silenced Goodison Park and went right down into Liverpool legend as THAT free kick.</p> [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wL0I7nRldhc&amp;w=640&amp;h=390] <p><strong>2001: Broad Daylight Owen Robbery</strong></p> <p>For 82 minutes in the 2001 FA Cup final at Cardiff, Arsenal seemed to be in control of matters. The Gunners seemed to have the measure of the Reds and when Freddie Ljunberg put them ahead in the 72nd minute, it was no more than they deserved. Liverpool seemed deflated and out for the count, and it seemed Arsenal might add another goal to their tally (Henry going close), but then out of nowhere, Michael Owen scored not once but twice (the seond on top of a stunning run that left two Arsenal defenders dead) in the final eight minutes of the game to snatch the cup out of the hands of Arsene Wenger&#8217;s men. Radio commentator Allan Green summed up the Reds that night: &#8220;Simply, they never give up.&#8221;</p> [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwE3h0iMjY8&amp;w=640&amp;h=390] <p><strong>2001: The night it rained goals</strong></p> <p>The Europa League was previously known as the UEFA Cup and in 2001, Liverpool played Alaves in the 2001 final. And a mix of adventurous attacking and abominable defending made many remember it as the night it rained goals. Liverpool got off to a flying start with Babel and Gerrard giving them a two goal lead within twenty minutes. Alonso pulled one back for Alaves, but when McAllister smashed home a penalty to make it 3-1, Liverpool seemed home and dry at half-time. Fat chance. Moreno scored twice within five minutes after the restart to make it 3-3. Fowler scored again to make it 4-3 with eighteen minutes to go, but Jordi Cryuff yanked the game into extra time with a goal in the dying minutes of the game. In those days, the team that scored first in extra time was declared the winner, and it was Alaves&#8217; Geli&#8217;s misfortune to head the ball into his own goal as he attempted to clear a McAllister free-kick. Liverpool had never been behind that night but had left it so late that many of their fans (and those of their opponents) had frayed nerves by the time the referee blew the final whistle.</p> [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXJmKYvBjZ8&amp;w=640&amp;h=390] <p><strong>2004: Greeks Gunned by Gerrard</strong></p> <p>Liverpool needed to win by a two goal margin against a well-organised and resilient Olympiakos side to get through to the next round of the Champions League. Never easy, the task seemed well nigh impossible when Rivaldo actually put the Greek club ahead. Liverpool went into the break a goal behind and needing three goals to stay in the League. They dared hope when Sinama Pongolle equalised shortly after the break but the Greek defence held firm and as the clock ticked away, Liverpool needed two goals in ten minutes against an opposition that refused to give an inch. Neil Mellor smashed in a rebound to give Liverpool the lead but many felt that it was too late for the Reds to get another. Cue Steven Gerrard who smashed in a long distance effort with four minutes remaining to steal the tie for Liverpool at the death. They would go on to reach the final, which would be played in Istanbul&#8230;.and which is the next item in this list.</p> [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM5XP-Ps7tk&amp;w=640&amp;h=390] <p><strong>2005: &#8216;THAT&#8217; night in Istanbul</strong></p> <p>On May 25, 2005, Liverpool pulled off perhaps the most amazing escape act in a major tournament final. Lined up against a powerful AC Milan side featuring the likes of Maldini, Kaka, Schevchenko and Crespo, Rafa Benitez&#8217;s Reds were torn to shreds in the first half of the game, finding themselves 0-3 down at the interval. With Kaka running riot, and Crespo infallible (he had scored two already), Liverpool seemed set for a hammering. Their fans responding by singing &#8220;We will win 4-3&#8221; during half time and spurred on by some canny changes (notably the introduction of Dietmar Hamann) by Benitez, Liverpool stormed back into the match. Gerrard, Smicer and Alonso scored to bring them level. And the Reds held their own in extra time before goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek pulled off a series of saves to win them the title in the penalty shoot out. The match has gone down in club legend as the &#8216;Miracle of Istanbul&#8217;.</p> [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKNfwfI8wHU&amp;w=640&amp;h=390] <p><strong>2006: Gerrard Hammers the Hammers!</strong></p> <p>Almost exactly a year after pulling off the Miracle of Istanbul, Liverpool added another stirring comeback to their record books. The Merseysiders had gone into the 2006 FA Cup final against West Ham as firm favourites, but events on the pitch had turned the script on its head. An own goal by the generally reliable Jamie Carragher and another strike by Dean Ashton put the Hammers 2-0 up within half an hour. Djibril Cisse and Steven Gerrard pulled Liverpool level but the cup seemed headed for London when Konchesky scored for West Ham again in the 64th minute to make it 3-2. The Hammers defended grimly and seemed to have the match wrapped up when Steven Gerrard conjured a thundering drive from well outside the penalty area to bring Liverpool level in added-on time. The Reds went on to win the penalty shoot out!</p> [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wL0I7nRldhc&amp;w=640&amp;h=390] <p><strong>2016: Nightmare for Norwich</strong></p> <p>It was well and truly a precursor of what happened against Dortmund last night. When Liverpool travelled to Norwich, they were considered favourites to overcome a side that was known to be well-organised but did not have the talent that Liverpool had. And things seemed to be going to script when Firminho put Liverpool ahead in the 18th minute. However, it all seemed to go pear shaped for Klopp&#8217;s men after that as Norwich scored not once but three times in the next 36 minutes, to leave Liverpool trailing 3-1, with slightly more than half an hour to play. In best Reds tradition, they refused to lie down and die. Henderson and Firminho (again) scored in the next ten minutes to level scores at 3-3. And when Milner smashed in a goal to make it 4-3 with quarter of an hour to go, Liverpool seemed to have three points in the bag. Norwich however seemed to have rescued a point when Bassong scored in added time, but with the seconds ticking away Adam Lallana knocked in the ball to win Liverpool the match in the sixth minute of added time. Klopp had his spectacles broken in the crazed celebrations that followed. Norwich could just wonder where it all went wrong. Dortmund must know the feeling.</p> [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdnQtsDA_KI&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]<img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2755372&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

ntained order by beating Spanish countryman Albert Montanes 6-2, 6-2 to make the Barcelona Open quarterfinals on Thursday.</p> <p>Nadal has yet to drop a set in six tour-level and challenger matches against Montanes. They exchanged early breaks but the top-seeded Nadal soon took control.</p> <p>Nadal broke serve five times and had 24 winners against only nine for Montanes, a wild card.</p> <p>&#8220;I had a great forehand today and the conditions were much better than yesterday,&#8221; said Nadal, who was 16 when he beat Montanes for the first time at a challenger in Barcelona.</p> <p>Coming off his first title of the year at the Monte Carlo Masters last week, Nadal will next face Fabio Fognini of Italy, who defeated eighth-seeded Viktor Troicki of Serbia 6-3, 6-2.</p> <p>Fognini eliminated Nadal in the third round of Barcelona last year, among his three wins over Nadal in 2015, including a five-setter in the third round at the U.S. Open.</p> <p>&#8220;Tomorrow will be a tough match against Fognini, he beat me three times last year and it was an up and down against him,&#8221; Nadal said.</p> <p>Nadal is trying to win his ninth title at the Barcelona Open, and first since 2013. He is on a seven-match winning streak.</p> <p>Second-seeded Kei Nishikori, the two-time defending champion, advanced to the quarterfinals by beating Frenchman Jeremy Chardy 6-3, 7-5.</p> <p>Nishikori lost serve at 5-4 in the second set, but broke back in the following game to eventually clinch the third-round victory. It was his 12th straight win in Barcelona.</p> <p>Nishikori will play 11th-seeded Ukrainian Alexandr Dolgopolov, who defeated Russian qualifier Karen Khachanov 6-4, 7-5 behind 10 aces.</p> <p>&#8220;It will be a very complicated match,&#8221; Nishikori said. &#8220;He is difficult to play, serves well, and uses the slice a lot. We are very good friends so it will be interesting.&#8221;</p> <p>Also, Malek Jaziri converted only two of 12 break points but was able to defeat Alexander Zverev of Germany 7-6 (5), 6-4 to set up a quarterfinal against sixth-seeded Benoit Paire of France, who eliminated ninth-seeded Pablo Cuevas of Uruguay 6-2, 6-4.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2764532&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: AP) <p>Fresh from winning his ninth Monte Carlo Masters title, Rafael Nadal is back in Spain to try and win the Barcelona Open for the ninth time.</p> <p>The 14-time Grand Slam champion has a bye in the first round and will face either Marcel Granollers or Daniel Munoz de la Nava in his opening match.</p> <p>The win over Gael Monfils on Sunday in Monte Carlo gave the Spaniard a record-equaling 28th Masters title.</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really happy to have won one of the most important tournaments of the year,&#8221; Nadal said Monday. &#8220;I won&#8217;t talk about what&#8217;s missing or what I&#8217;m lacking right now. I have to be satisfied with what I&#8217;ve accomplished.&#8221;</p> <p>With the French Open approaching, Nadal is improving on clay. He has won the title at Roland Garros a record nine times, but lost to Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals last year.</p> <p>&#8220;This part of the season, with Monte Carlo, Barcelona, Madrid, Rome and then Roland Garros, is the most emotional part of the year for me,&#8221; said Nadal, who added that he looked forward to improving his game further on his favorite surface in Spain.</p> <p>&#8220;I play at home in Barcelona and next week, too, in Madrid, and it&#8217;s a fact that I always enjoy playing in front of Spanish crowds, so I&#8217;m very excited.&#8221;</p> <p>Nadal is the biggest name at the Barcelona Open, but the draw also includes defending champion Kei Nishikori, David Ferrer and Richard Gasquet.</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good to see Rafa playing at a great level again,&#8221; said Nishikori. &#8220;I&#8217;ll play a match at a time and hope I can stay here for a long time.&#8221;</p> <p>In the first round on Monday, Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic, Evgeny Donskoy of Russia, Malek Jaziri of Tunisia, Victor Estrella Burgos of the Dominican Republic and Inigo Cervantes of Spain all won.</p> <p>Also, Teymuraz Gabashvili of Russia turned his match around to beat Nicolas Almagro of Spain 1-6, 7-6 (3), 6-2, while Albert Montanes beat Roberto Carballes Baena in an all-Spanish match.</p> <p>Other first-round matches saw Russia&#8217;s 19-year-old Karen Khachanov advance after beating Aljaz Bedene of Britain and Germany&#8217;s Alexander Zverev going through after defeating countryman Jan-Lennard Struff.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2759704&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: PTI) <p>Delhi High Court on Thursday asked the chief of Maxx Mobile to inform it about the steps taken on the order refraining them from selling any product having endorsement of Indian cricket captain M S Dhoni.</p> <p>Justice J R Midha also directed Maxx Mobile CMD Ajjay Agarwal to file an affidavit containing information about the stocks available with them when the order was passed on November 17, 2014 and the number of products sold thereafter.</p> <p>&#8220;What instruction it (Maxx Mobile) has given with regard to removal of petitioner&#8217;s (Dhoni) name from the product (mobile and its box) to the printer,&#8221; the court asked.</p> <p>It directed the company to file an affidavit within four weeks and listed the matter for further hearing on July 29.</p> <p>The court&#8217;s direction came on a petition filed by Dhoni seeking contempt proceedings against Agarwal for defying the high court&#8217;s November 17, 2014 direction asking Maxx Mobile to &#8220;refrain from selling any products&#8221; which use or claimed to have been endorsed by Dhoni.</p> <p>The November 2014 direction was passed on a plea by Dhoni and Rhiti Sports who have alleged that Maxx Mobilink Pvt Ltd have not paid dues of over crores of rupees which was agreed upon for using the cricketer&#8217;s name on their products.</p> <p>Dhoni&#8217;s counsel Gaurav Mitra had said the endorsement agreement between him and the company had expired in December 2012 but Maxx was still using his name to sell its products and not paying him the dues.</p> <p>Dhoni&#8217;s claim was opposed by Agarwal&#8217;s counsel Sanjeev Bhadari, who submitted that no mobile phones were sold in the name of the cricketer.</p> <p>&#8220;Mr Dhoni has to attend certain shooting, which he failed to do. The petitioner was also under certain obligation as per the agreement&#8230;,&#8221; Bhadari argued.</p> <p>This was countered by Dhoni&#8217;s counsel who said that the company has to pay Rs 70 crore, for which the matter is before the arbitrator.</p> <p>&#8220;Despite the order against the company, they are still selling and promoting its products by using name and image of Mr Dhoni,&#8221; the counsel contended.</p> <p>He submitted that &#8220;MSD&#8221; is the short form of name of M S Dhoni and number 7 is his Jersey number, which he wears while playing for the Indian Cricket Team.</p> <p>&#8220;It clearly shows that Maxx Mobile is still using the name and image for promoting its brand and increasing sales of its products,&#8221; he added.</p> <p>The cricketer, in his contempt plea, has also sought direction to seize all the products/mobile handsets and such other articles where his name and image is being used to sell and promote these products.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2764378&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: Reuters) <p>Rafael Nadal beat Andy Murray 2-6, 6-4, 6-2 on Saturday to play for his ninth Monte Carlo Masters title.</p> <p>If Nadal beats Gael Monfils in the final on Sunday, he will earn a record-equaling 28th Masters title, tied with Novak Djokovic.</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a very important week for me,&#8221; Nadal said. &#8220;I increased the speed of the ball and played a little bit more inside the court, because Andy had control of the point too many times in the first set.&#8221;</p> <p>Monfils eased past Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-1, 6-3 in all-French semifinal, breaking Tsonga&#8217;s serve six times in less than half the time Nadal spent turning the table on Murray.</p> <p>The last French player to win here was Cedric Pioline in 2000 _ who was also the last French finalist _ and Monfils is the clear outsider considering he has lost 11 of 13 matches against Nadal, including all four on clay.</p> <p>For Murray, it was a missed opportunity to become the first British player in the final in 56 years, and to beat Nadal for only the second time on clay _ having routed him 6-3, 6-2 in the Madrid Masters final last year.</p> <p>&#8220;I missed some shots, but you have to take chances against the best players,&#8221; Murray said. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t do that, you&#8217;re going to lose anyway.&#8221;</p> <p>Murray dominated on his serve _ and pressured Nadal&#8217;s _ throughout the first set, using his drop shot effectively. But Nadal broke Murray to start the second set on his way to a third win against Murray in a semifinal here.</p> <p>The Spaniard found his serving range in the deciding set, twice holding at love and eventually clinching victory on his fifth match point.</p> <p>Nadal, who won the last of his eight straight titles in 2012, then lost the final to Djokovic in 2013, has not won a tournament this year. The last of 67 titles was on clay at Hamburg last August while his last final was in January, losing to Djokovic in Doha.</p> <p>Some tension showed as he served for the match _ with a full 10 minutes between his first match point and his successful fifth.</p> <p>He got the win when Murray&#8217;s forehand swipe hit the net, improving to 17-6 in career meetings against Murray and 7-1 on clay.</p> <p>Murray lost to Nadal in the semis here in 2009 and 2011 when the Spaniard was the undisputed world&#8217;s best on clay. But Nadal has since proven vulnerable, and the nine-time French Open champion relinquished his Roland Garros title last year to Stan Wawrinka.</p> <p>Murray broke to lead 4-2 in the first set, and a superb drop shot from Murray gave him set point, which he clinched when Nadal netted a forehand.</p> <p>The major turning point came when Nadal broke for 4-3 after Murray missed an easy smash at the net, allowing Nadal to pass him down the line.</p> <p>Nadal then saved two break points in the next game to lead 5-3 as the players thrilled the crowd with some spectacular rallies.</p> <p>After Nadal served out the second set, during which Murray got only 39 percent of his first serves in, the Spaniard broke him again at the start of the deciding set with an exquisite drop shot. Nadal stopped playing momentarily after dirt got in his eye.</p> <p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to stop when Andy was serving because (it) is not fair,&#8221; Nadal said. &#8220;But every time it was bothering me more and more and I was losing little bit of the vision, so I had to go to the chair and put some water (in my eye).&#8221;</p> <p>Trailing 3-1, Murray&#8217;s composure wilted in the sunshine as he remonstrated several times with the chair umpire.</p> <p>He was evasive about the reasons for his frustration.</p> <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how much of a bearing any of that had on the outcome,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2756663&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

<img class="size-full wp-image-2755408" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/roger-federer-m.jpg" alt="Roger Federer was knocked out of the Monte Carlo Masters. (Source: AP)" /> Roger Federer was knocked out of the Monte Carlo Masters. (Source: AP) <p>Rafael Nadal beat Stan Wawrinka 6-1, 6-4 on Friday to reach the Monte Carlo Masters semifinals, where he will face Andy Murray again.</p> <p>Roger Federer lost 3-6, 6-2, 7-5 to Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, despite being two points from victory when leading 5-4 in the decider with Tsonga 15-30 down on his serve.</p> <p>This was Federer&#8217;s comeback tournament after more than two months out following arthroscopic surgery on his left knee for torn cartilage, and the defeat was softened by relief at coming through the tournament unscathed.</p> <p>&#8220;It was good to play back-to-back, yesterday and today, good to play 2 hours 10 (minutes) today,&#8221; Federer said. &#8220;It was nice to play an intense match. I&#8217;m happy how the body reacted.&#8221;</p> <p>With Federer, top-ranked Novak Djokovic and Wawrinka the French Open champion all out, Nadal will be favorite to win a ninth Monte Carlo title.</p> <p>&#8220;He is still a major player on clay,&#8221; Federer said of Nadal, whose last title here came in 2012.</p> <p>In a one-sided contest between former champions, Nadal broke Wawrinka four times, and made the semifinals for the 11th time.</p> <p>&#8220;I defended well, I moved well,&#8221; Nadal said. &#8220;When I had the opportunity, I was trying to control the point.&#8221;</p> <p>Murray took out Milos Raonic 6-2, 6-0 for the second time this year.</p> <p>&#8220;If I play like I did today, I&#8217;ll have a chance,&#8221; said Murray, who lost to Nadal in the semifinals in 2009 and 2011 when Nadal was winning eight consecutive Monte Carlo titles.</p> <p>Murray beat Nadal in the Madrid Masters final last year, when he won his first two career titles on clay.</p> <p>Murray, who trails Nadal 16-6 overall in career meetings and 6-1 on clay, thinks patience will be the key factor against the nine-time French Open champion.</p> <p>&#8220;He can make you go for winners from uncomfortable positions,&#8221; said Murray, who did not face a break point against the big-serving Raonic. &#8220;You have to not allow that to happen.&#8221;</p> <p>Nadal improved to 15-3 in career matches against Wawrinka, who began as a winner in three of their last five contests.</p> <p>Having saved 15 of 17 break points in the third round against Dominic Thiem, Nadal conceded only one chance this time.</p> <p>Wawrinka drew jeers from the crowd in the fifth game of the first set when he broke his racket, angrily bending it around his thigh.</p> <p>The Swiss player was also frustrated by the noise level coming from people enjoying their lunch in the restaurant perched above center court.</p> <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe they saw a lot of the match &#8230; I think they also drank a lot of alcohol,&#8221; Wawrinka said. &#8220;When you don&#8217;t play well and you&#8217;re not in your match, it can bother you.&#8221;</p> <p>Nadal had a more moderate view, saying it has been &#8220;the same story every day (since) I came here for the first time in 2003.&#8221;</p> <p>Following his countryman Wawrinka onto center court, Federer looked like beating Tsonga for the 12th time in 17 matches.</p> <p>But after holding serve in a tense 10th game of the deciding set, the eighth-seeded Tsonga hit two powerful winners off his backhand and forehand to break Federer for the fifth time.</p> <p>Serving for the match, Tsonga gave Federer another opening when he trailed 30-0, and again at 30-30 when Federer missed an easy volley at the net and swiped the ball into the crowd in frustration.</p> <p>Federer&#8217;s timing was off and he rushed a forehand on the first match point, giving Tsonga his sixth career win against Federer and his second in their four contests on clay.</p> <p>But for Federer, who has 17 majors among 88 career titles, this defeat took a back seat to his recovery.</p> <p>&#8220;It was unfortunate because I had my chances,&#8221; said Federer, who beat Tsonga in the quarterfinals here two years ago. &#8220;But in this tournament, (it) really doesn&#8217;t matter at all if I missed those chances.&#8221;</p> <p>Tsonga, meanwhile, next faces countryman 13th-seeded Gael Monfils, who beat Spaniard Marcel Granollers 6-2, 6-4.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2755112&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: Reuters) <p>Andy Murray avoided following Novak Djokovic out of the Monte Carlo Masters exit door after surviving a scare against local favourite Benoit Paire to reach the quarter-finals with a 2-6 7-5 7-5 victory on Thursday.</p> <p>A day after world number one Djokovic suffered a stunning defeat by 55th-ranked Czech Jiri Vesely, Murray looked in trouble against Paire before subduing his opponent to set up a meeting with Canadian Milos Raonic.</p> <p>World number two Murray was 5-4 down in the third set when Paire cracked under pressure and lost the remaining three games to hand victory to the Briton.</p> <p>&#8220;I panicked. It&#8217;s the biggest disappointment of my career,&#8221; said Paire, who won the first set easily and was two breaks up in the second before Murray fought back.</p> <p>Eight-times Monte Carlo champion Rafa Nadal was made to work hard by Dominic Thiem before advancing to the last eight 7-5 6-3 after the Austrian wasted 15 of 16 break points in the opening set.</p> <p>The Spaniard will next face Stan Wawrinka after the Swiss, who won the claycourt Masters in 2014, demolished Frenchman Gilles Simon 6-1 6-2.</p> <p>&#8220;From the start I was very strict with myself. I had to keep my tactics, be patient, attack him whenever I had the opportunity,&#8221; said fourth seed Wawrinka.</p> <p>&#8220;My concentration was very good. This is important against Gilles. From the start I needed to dominate and be very present on the court. I succeeded in doing that.&#8221;</p> <p>Third seed Roger Federer, back in action after a 10-week layoff, eased past Spain&#8217;s Roberto Bautista Agut 6-2 6-4.</p> <p>The Swiss will face Jo-Wilfried Tsonga after he beat fellow Frenchman Lucas Pouille 6-4 6-4.</p> <p>France&#8217;s Gael Monfils, the 13th seed, ended the run of Djokovic&#8217;s conqueror Vesely with a 6-1 6-2 win.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2753746&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

<img class="wp-image-2753724 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/maria-sharapova_ap-m.jpg" alt="Maria Sharapova" /> Maria Sharapova make up the largest contingent of those who have tested positive. (Source: AP) <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin waded into the debate over meldonium on Thursday, saying the banned substance should not be considered a performance-enhancing drug.</p> <p>There have been at least 172 failed drug tests for meldonium worldwide since the Latvian-made heart-drug was banned in 2016. Russian athletes _ including tennis star Maria Sharapova _ make up the largest contingent of those who have tested positive.</p> <p>&#8220;This substance was never considered as doping,&#8221; Putin said during a marathon phone-in program on Russian television.</p> <p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t influence the result. That&#8217;s totally certain. It just keeps the heart muscles in good condition under high load.&#8221;</p> <p>Among those watching in the studio was Ekaterina Bobrova, an Olympic gold medal-winning ice dancer who is suspended after testing positive for meldonium.</p> <p>The company which makes meldonium has marketed it as improving energy levels in heart patients, while its inventor has previously said it increased the endurance of Soviet troops. However, the company also says meldonium should not be considered a performance-enhancer.</p> <p><strong>Read: <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/tennis/maria-sharapova-still-faces-meldonium-hearing-says-international-tennis-federation/">Maria Sharapova still faces meldonium hearing</a></strong></p> <p>Meldonium was routinely used as a supplement by athletes in Eastern Europe before it was banned.</p> <p>While Putin said he did not think authorities were targeting Russia in the decision to ban meldonium, he criticized the World Anti-Doping Agency for not carrying out research earlier on how long the drug takes to leave the body.</p> <p>&#8220;There was no proper data,&#8221; he said.</p> <p>Some athletes say they stopped taking meldonium before it was banned but have still tested positive, and WADA said Wednesday that athletes in that position could avoid sanctions if that argument is backed up by data showing a low concentration of the substance in their sample.</p> <p>Putin was noncommittal when asked by Russian track head coach Yuri Borzakovsky about the team&#8217;s chances of being allowed to compete at the Olympics in August. Russia was suspended from global track and field in November after a WADA report detailed widespread, state-sponsored drug use.</p> <p>&#8220;They&#8217;re obviously in a hard situation but you have to be ready for anything, it seems to me, if you ask my opinion,&#8221; Putin said. &#8220;Of course we will fight for decisions to be fair. The Russian Sports Ministry, our sports organizations are working with good lawyers at a world level on this issue and are studying all aspects of the topic.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2753710&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: Reuters) <p>A relieved Roger Federer cruised to victory at the Monaco Masters on Tuesday in his first match in more than two months following a knee operation that left him fearing for his playing career.</p> <p>Beating Spaniard Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 6-3, 6-4 in the second round is nothing special for a 17-time Grand Slam champion with 88 career titles. But it was more about relief than anything else for Federer, who had arthroscopic surgery on February 3 for torn cartilage in his left knee.</p> <p>Casting his mind back to the hours following his operation, Federer recalled his feelings &#8211; which were a mixture of the rational and irrational.</p> <p>&#8220;When I woke up and I looked at the knee I got the impression that it wasn&#8217;t my leg,&#8221; the Swiss star said. &#8220;I was in a bit of pain as well, and that&#8217;s the moment when I became quickly afraid what would happen next.</p> <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s when you realize, that if you want to be a professional player, you need to be able to go flat out.&#8221;</p> <p>Added to the worry of the first operation of his career at the advanced age of 34, Federer also went under general anesthetic for the first time in his life, having previously had only a local anesthetic when he had wisdom teeth removed.</p> <p>&#8220;I was scared before the operation and I was scared after the operation,&#8221; Federer said. &#8220;I was scared when I was on crutches, then when I was walking differently on crutches, then walking in the stairs, then walking without the crutches. It&#8217;s like taking a step forward each time, like being a kid.&#8221;</p> <p>Despite the previous fears, Federer is totally confident that his knee will hold up.</p> <p>&#8220;My doctor told me &#8216;Look, now you&#8217;re healed you can really go for it.&#8217; If there is any fear left in my mind then it comes from me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But there is no pain left and that&#8217;s incredibly reassuring. I think now it&#8217;s a case of how the knee is going to feel after three games?&#8217; But I&#8217;m not too scared about that because I&#8217;ve really pushed things in training.&#8221;</p> <p>Federer hadn&#8217;t played since losing to top-ranked Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open semifinals in late January.</p> <p>&#8220;I was very excited and tense,&#8221; said Federer, who was scheduled to play at the Miami Masters two weeks ago but pulled out because of a stomach virus. &#8220;It was a perfect match, because it was close in the beginning and then I could go on a roll.&#8221;</p> <p>In sunny conditions, Federer looked untroubled before a rare blip saw him broken at love, when serving for the match at 5-2. But he concluded his straight-set victory by winning his next service game.</p> <p>After Andy Murray had overcome some sloppy serving to beat Pierre-Hugues Herbert 6-2, 4-6, 6-3 in his second-round match, Federer looked sharp whenever he came to the net.</p> <p>&#8220;I could go freely,&#8221; said Federer, who plays either No. 14 Roberto Bautista Agut or Jeremy Chardy in the third round on Thursday.</p> <p>Federer geed himself up with a shout of &#8216;Come on&#8217; when he broke for a 2-1 lead in the second, then went up a gear when he broke Garcia-Lopez to love in the fifth game and then opened with an ace in the sixth.</p> <p>His form briefly stalled in the eighth game, when he was broken to love, but he clinched victory when Garcia-Lopez failed to return a stinging backhand down the line.</p> <p>Murray, the tournament&#8217;s No. 2, sounded worried after his match.</p> <p>&#8220;The consistency has not been there, maybe not as sharp as I could be mentally. Concentration&#8217;s not been so good,&#8221; said Murray, who next plays either Joao Sousa or No. 16 Benoit Paire. &#8220;That&#8217;s something that, especially on this surface, needs to be better &#8211; because on grass you can get away with hitting a couple of big serves and the point&#8217;s over.&#8221;</p> <p>Eighth-seeded Jo-Wilfried Tsonga won 7-6 (1), 7-6 (5) against Spaniard Pablo Carreno Busta, and No. 15 Gilles Simon also advanced to the third round with a 6-4, 6-3 win against Grigor Dimitrov.</p> <p>In first-round play, No. 11 David Goffin of Belgium broke Feliciano Lopez&#8217;s serve five times in a 7-5, 6-0 win.</p> <p>There were also wins for Jiri Vesely, Teymuraz Gabashvili, Pablo Cuevas, Philipp Kohlschreiber, Fernando Verdasco, Taro Daniel, Damir Dzumhur, Paolo Lorenzi and Sousa.</p> <p>Vesely faces defending champion Djokovic on Wednesday.</p> <p>Djokovic has reached 19 finals in the past 21 tournaments, winning 15, and is also in Federer&#8217;s half of the draw.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2750772&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: Reuters) <p>Richard Gasquet converted all six of his break points as he beat Nicolas Almagro 6-4, 6-0 on Monday, and Milos Raonic had 13 aces in a 6-3, 7-5 win against wild card Marco Cecchinato in the first round of the Monte Carlo Masters.</p> <p>Raonic broke in the 11th game of the second set and quickly moved 40-0 up as he served for the match. Cecchinato saved two match points before the Italian sent a high backhand wide on the next point.</p> <p>&#8220;I let myself fall into a little bit too much of a defensive pattern where I was playing a little too far back,&#8221; Raonic said. &#8220;It didn&#8217;t allow me to use my game to dictate. I was a little bit more reactive rather than proactive.&#8221;</p> <p>Although his big-serving game is more effective on quicker surfaces, the 10th-seeded Canadian thinks the slower clay still suits his game.</p> <p>&#8220;It gives me time,&#8221; said Raonic, who lost to Stan Wawrinka in the quarterfinals here two years ago. &#8220;It allows me to stay ahead if you treat it the right way.&#8221;</p> <p>Raonic will play either Spaniard Daniel Gimeno-Traver or Uruguayan Pablo Cuevas in the second round.</p> <p>No. 12 Dominic Thiem of Austria overcame a difficult first set, where he dropped his serve twice, to beat qualifier Jan-Lennard Struff of Germany 1-6, 6-3, 6-4.</p> <p>Gael Monfils, a semifinalist last year and seeded 13th, also advanced, beating Gilles Muller of Luxembourg 7-5, 6-0.</p> <p>Monfils took all five of his break-point chances against Muller, as both he and Gasquet were watched by former French Open champion Yannick Noah &#8211; who is now France&#8217;s Davis Cup captain.</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good that he&#8217;s here, that he comes and sees the players,&#8221; said the ninth-seeded Gasquet, who next faces countryman Lucas Pouille.</p> <p>No. 16 Benoit Paire of France rallied to beat Spaniard Inigo Cervantes 4-6, 6-2, 7-6 (6); Roberto Bautista Agut defeated Albert Ramos-Vinolas 6-4, 7-6 (4) in an all-Spanish match and Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov beat qualifier Filip Krajinovic 6-3, 6-2.</p> <p>British player Aljaz Bedene had eight aces in a 6-2, 6-3 win against Czech Lukas Rosol and next faces fifth-seeded Rafael Nadal of Spain, who won the last of his eight straight titles here in 2012.</p> <p>Alexander Zverev eased past Russian Andrey Rublev 6-1, 6-3 in a match of two 18-year-olds and he next plays No. 7 David Ferrer, the 2011 runner-up.</p> <p>There were also wins for Spaniards Guillermo Garcia-Lopez and Pablo Carreno Busta and Frenchman Pierre-Hugues Herbert.</p> <p>No. 2 Andy Murray and No. 3 Roger Federer are in second-round action on Tuesday.</p> <p>Murray faces Herbert and Federer, who is returning from more than two months out following surgery on his left knee, takes on Garcia-Lopez.</p> <p>With play finishing somewhat early, Federer went out on center court for around 40 minutes to practice with Russian Teymuraz Gabashvili.</p> <p>Top-ranked Novak Djokovic begins his title defense on Wednesday against either Gabashvili or Czech Jiri Vesely, who play on Tuesday.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2749473&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: AP) <p>American seventh seed Sloane Stephens captured her third title of 2016 by defeating Russian qualifier Elena Vesnina 7-6(4) 6-2 in the final of the Volvo Car Open clay court event in South Carolina on Sunday.</p> <p>The 23-year-old American raced out to a 5-2 lead before Vesnina, the 2011 Charleston finalist, used a slew of winners to win four consecutive games before moving within one point of winning the opening set.</p> <p>Stephens, however, held her nerve producing some of her best tennis in the tiebreak before cruising through the second set.</p> <p>&#8220;I just said to myself, &#8216;You have to fight for every point and compete.&#8217; She&#8217;s a great player, so I knew I had to stay in every point,&#8221; said Stephens.</p> <p>&#8220;When I got a couple of opportunities, I took them, so that was great.&#8221;</p> <p>The win marked the fourth career WTA title for an in-form Stephens, who has been close to her best for nearly a year after winning her maiden title in Washington last August followed by wins this year in Auckland and Acapulco.</p> <p>Stephens, who was 1-5 in Charleston before this week, had two straight-set wins to open the tournament and then saved a match point against rising Russian teen Daria Kasatkina in the quarter-finals.</p> <p>She faced defending champion Angelique Kerber in the semi-finals where she had a 6-1 3-0 lead before the top-seeded German retired with a viral illness.</p> <p>Vesnina had caught fire on the unique green clay courts of Charleston where she arrived as the world number 85 and having won two matches in the qualifying.</p> <p>En route to becoming the first qualifier to make the Charleston final in the tournament&#8217;s 44 years, Vesnina upset Switzerland&#8217;s Belinda Bencic in the second round and Italy&#8217;s Sara Errani in the semis.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2748330&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: USA Today) <p>Novak Djokovic&#8217;s bid to finally master clay and win the elusive French Open title starts with his title defense at the Monte Carlo Masters, where Rafael Nadal once crushed the competition.</p> <p>The top-ranked Serb has won 11 Grand Slams but the French Open continues to elude him, having lost the final to Stan Wawrinka at Roland Garros last year and twice to Nadal.</p> <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like the word &#8216;obsession&#8217; because it doesn&#8217;t come from the right emotion,&#8221; Djokovic told reporters on Sunday. &#8220;But of course being the only Grand Slam I haven&#8217;t won gives me even more incentive to give my best there this year.&#8221;</p> <p>Few would bet against Djokovic winning in Paris given his red-hot form but part of his renowned discipline involves stopping from looking that far ahead.</p> <p>&#8220;When you need to operate as a human machine, you need to do that only in the present moment and the present time,&#8221; said Djokovic, who sets aside time to perfect his inner balance. &#8220;Not Buddhism, specifically, but mindfulness, this holistic approach that allows me to maximize my being from every aspect. Not just physical but mental, emotional, spiritual. I try to be disciplined with all these different exercises that I do on a daily level.&#8221;</p> <p>Nadal, who lost to Djokovic in the Monte Carlo semifinals last year, won eight straight titles here from 2005-12 until Djokovic ended the Spaniard&#8217;s run in the 2013 final.</p> <p>Winning Monte Carlo was always the springboard that led to victory in Paris, and he thinks it will be tough to stop Djokovic doing the same.</p> <p>Since beating Djokovic in the 2013 U.S. Open final, Nadal has lost 10 of their 11 meetings &#8211; the only win in that time coming when he beat Djokovic in the French Open final two years ago.</p> <p>&#8220;He&#8217;s going to be the favorite for every tournament (until) somebody shows something different,&#8221; Nadal said Sunday with an air of inevitability. &#8220;He is (playing) with an unbelievable dynamic.&#8221;</p> <p>Since 2015, Djokovic has reached 19 finals in 21 tournaments, winning 15 and losing four finals.</p> <p>In late February, he lost to Spaniard Feliciano Lopez in the Dubai quarterfinals &#8211; where Djokovic retired with of an eye infection after losing the first set.</p> <p>That leaves big-serving Croat Ivo Karolovic as the only other to beat him outside of a final in that time, winning a hard-fought quarterfinal on outdoor hard courts in Doha, Qatar, in January 2015.</p> <p>Djokovic&#8217;s recent win at the Miami Masters was a record 28th in Masters &#8211; one more than Nadal &#8211; and saw him equal Andre Agassi&#8217;s six titles in Miami as well as clinching the Indian Wells-Miami double for a third successive year.</p> <p>&#8220;From one side, yes, I am pleasantly surprised with what I have achieved in last two years,&#8221; Djokovic said. &#8220;From the other side, I&#8217;ve always expected myself to be at this level. Everybody peaks at different stages of their careers and for me it&#8217;s right now.&#8221;</p> <p>Nadal has been swept away by the meteoric ascension of Djokovic, who is closing in on $100 million in career prize money.</p> <p>The 28-year-old Djokovic, a year younger than Nadal, has 63 career titles. He is only four behind Nadal, who has yet to win one this year and won just three last year compared with 10 in 2013.</p> <p>Djokovic leads Nadal 25-23 in their career head-to-heads; has a 23-22 lead over Roger Federer and a dominant 22-9 record against two-time Grand Slam champion Andy Murray.</p> <p>Djokovic did not drop a set in Miami and only dropped one set on his way to a second Monte Carlo success last year, against Czech Tomas Berdych in the final.</p> <p>&#8220;What he&#8217;s achieving right now is just exceptional. It&#8217;s just the same as when Roger was at his peak,&#8221; Berdych said. &#8220;One season I think (Federer) lost three or four matches so it&#8217;s quite similar to Novak last year and like Nadal did one year. Within 10 years each of them took three years of that domination.&#8221;</p> <p>Djokovic is in the same half of the draw as Federer here and has a bye to the second round &#8211; where he faces Czech Jiri Vesely or Russian Teymuraz Gabashvili.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2747675&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: AP) <p>Sloane Stephens reached her third WTA final of the year when top-seeded Angelique Kerber of Germany retired in the second set of their semi-final at the Volvo Car Open in South Carolina on Saturday due to a viral illness.</p> <p>Seventh seed Stephens had dominated the match played in blustery conditions on the green clay in Charleston, leading 6-1 3-0 when Australian Open champion Kerber waved an end to the match.</p> <p>The 23-year-old American will face Russian qualifier Elena Vesnina, 29, who ousted fifth-seeded Sara Errani of Italy 6-4 4-6 6-2 in a battle that stretched for two hours and 20 minutes.</p> <p>Kerber was attended to by trainers after losing her serve to the American to fall behind 2-0 in the second set, but gave it another try before deciding to retire.</p> <p>Stephens, who has won titles this year at Auckland and Acapulco, was in total command of her game, hitting 14 winners while committing only four unforced errors in the match and did not face a single break point.</p> <p>&#8220;I think I executed very well,&#8221; the 25th-ranked Stephens told ESPN.</p> <p>&#8220;The wind was crazy today. I shanked on the first shot because it was going everywhere. I was happy I was able to keep the ball in the court.&#8221;</p> <p>Kerber had much more trouble handling the conditions and Stephen&#8217;s deliveries as she made 16 unforced errors in the 10 games.</p> <p>Vesnina, who won the mixed doubles title at the Australian Open with Brazilian Bruno Soares, made the critical break in the sixth game of the third set for a 4-2 lead and broke again to secure her place in Sunday&#8217;s final.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2747053&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

I got frustrated at home and I didn&#8217;t watch tennis on TV because it was sad for me,&#8221; Del Potro, who stunned Roger Federer to win the 2009 U.S. Open, told the website of the ATP World Tour.</p> <p>&#8220;It was close. But now, I have many good things to take from the tour. I would like to play tennis and that&#8217;s it.&#8221;</p> <p>Del Potro reached number four in the world in 2009 and was expected to follow up his U.S. Open triumph with more grand slam titles only for his injuries to strike.</p> <p>Despite being a right-hander, Del Potro&#8217;s left wrist has been the source of his discomfort, preventing him striking his trademark double-fisted backhand drive.</p> <p>It first troubled him in 2010 when he endured a nine-month break from the game after surgery.</p> <p>He recovered to return to the world&#8217;s top five by 2013 when he played an epic Wimbledon semi-final against Novak Djokovic.</p> <p>However, since the start of 2014 he has completed only 22 matches with two more bouts of surgery required to his tendon.</p> <p>Despite pulling out of the Miami Open, which finished on Sunday, after feeling some discomfort in the wrist, del Potro remains upbeat.</p> <p>&#8220;Hopefully after my third surgery, the problem is almost fixed and I am here, playing tennis again,&#8221; he said.</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m still confident in my game and still looking forward to playing with the top guys in the same condition, not like (Indian Wells), when I couldn&#8217;t hit my backhand at 100 per cent. Maybe in the future I will get that chance.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2743654&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

<img class="wp-image-2737930 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/djokovic-m.jpg" alt="" /> Novak Djokovic continued his domination of men&#8217;s tennis with a 6-3 6-3 victory over Kei Nishikori in the final of Miami Open (Source: AP) <p>World number one Novak Djokovic surpassed Roger Federer as the highest-earning player in ATP Tour history after capturing a third consecutive Miami Open crown with a 6-3, 6-4 victory over Japan&#8217;s Kei Nishikori.</p> <p>Djokovic&#8217;s win his sixth career victory in Miami to equal Andre Agassi&#8217;s record saw him pocket $1.028 million (902,000 euros), taking him past Federer as the all-time ATP earnings leader with $98,199,548 to the Swiss great&#8217;s $97,855,881.</p> <p>&#8220;It was my best performance of the tournament,&#8221; the 28-year-old Serbian said yesterday. &#8220;It came at the right time against a great player.&#8221;</p> <p>Djokovic&#8217;s win also took him to a record 28th career ATP Masters title, one better than the old mark he shared with Spain&#8217;s Rafael Nadal.</p> <p>&#8220;The fact I managed to win the most Masters ever is a remarkable achievement I&#8217;m very proud of,&#8221; Djokovic said.</p> <p>Sunday&#8217;s victory was also Djokovic&#8217;s 714th career win, moving him to 11th on the all-time list, one more than his coach, German six-time Grand Slam champion Boris Becker.</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful and proud of all the achievements,&#8221; Djokovic said. &#8220;To put myself in position to have the records and be in the history books is a great accomplishment &#8230; Hopefully I can make many more records.&#8221;</p> <p>Djokovic, who claimed his 63rd career ATP title, stretched his Miami win streak to 16 matches with his 30th victory in 31 starts over five years.</p> <p>His first Masters win came at Miami in 2007 and still inspires him.</p> <p>&#8220;It has been a springboard for everything that has come after,&#8221; Djokovic said. &#8220;Opened a lot of doors for me. Made me realize I could beat the best players in the world.&#8221;</p> <p>Djokovic improved to 28-1 this year, the lone loss coming when an eye problem forced a Dubai quarter-final retirement against Spain&#8217;s Feliciano Lopez.</p> <p>Djokovic, who in January won at Doha and captured an 11th career Grand Slam title at the Australian Open, also swept the US double of Miami and Indian Wells for the third year in a row and fourth time overall.</p> <p>&#8220;The most successful month of my career is March,&#8221; Djokovic said. &#8220;I enjoy these two tournaments the most of any in my career.&#8221;</p> <p>Nishikori, who made 30 unforced errors against just 10 winners, suffered his sixth consecutive loss in meetings with Djokovic, who leads their career rivalry 7-2.</p> <p>&#8220;It was a tough match,&#8221; Nishikori said. &#8220;Playing Novak is always a great challenge for me.&#8221;</p> <p>Djokovic, who didn&#8217;t drop a set at Miami, broke Nishikori in four of his first five service games to seize command.</p> <p>&#8220;He played great tennis. That&#8217;s why I couldn&#8217;t play like I wanted,&#8221; Nishikori said. &#8220;My serve wasn&#8217;t going. It was a shame to have that because he had a great return and I felt a lot of pressure on my service games. He played good and I could have played a little better.&#8221;</p> <p>Djokovic took advantage of a Nishikori miss-hit backhand to break in the eighth game and held at love to grab the opening set after 34 minutes.</p> <p>Nishikori surrendered a break to begin the second set with consecutive errant backhands.</p> <p>Nishikori, who said his left knee was fine despite having a trainer treat it in the second set, hit a forehand long to be broken to end the match after 86 minutes.</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s tough to find his weakness,&#8221; Nishikori said. &#8220;He has great defense. It&#8217;s tough to break his game.&#8221;</p> <p>As part of his victory celebration, Djokovic kissed his left hand and patted it on the court several times.</p> <p>&#8220;I certainly hope the love affair continues in the years to come,&#8221; Djokovic said.</p> <p>Nishikori, 26, was in only his second career ATP Masters final, after Madrid in 2014, while Djokovic was in his 11th consecutive such final, improving his record in that run to 56-2.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2737924&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

Oosthuizen became the latest top golfer to opt out of Rio Olympics. Golf is making a comeback to the Olympics after 112 years. (Source: AP) <p>Former British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen on Thursday became the third high-profile golfer to withdraw from this summer&#8217;s Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, citing family and schedule issues.</p> <p>South African Oosthuizen follows what could become a pattern, started last week by Fiji&#8217;s former world number one Vijay Singh and continued on Tuesday by Australia&#8217;s 2013 Masters champion Adam Scott.</p> <p>&#8220;I have always represented South Africa with pride so didn&#8217;t make my decision without a great deal of thought,&#8221; 2010 British Open winner Oosthuizen said in a statement released by his management company.</p> <p>&#8220;I would like to wish our golfers and all other athletes competing in Brazil all the very best for success.&#8221;</p> <p>According to his management company, world number 12 Oosthuizen informed South Africa&#8217;s Olympic committee of his decision &#8220;after long deliberations citing family and schedule issues&#8221;.</p> <p>Singh, a three-times major winner, announced last week that the Zika virus was his main reason for skipping the Rio Games.</p> <p>&#8220;I would like to play the Olympics, but the Zika virus, you know&#8230;&#8221; Singh, 53, told Golf Channel. &#8220;I feel bad, I wanted to play and finally decided against it. It&#8217;s in the middle of the Tour over here and I&#8217;m trying to figure out my game.&#8221;</p> <p>U.S. health officials have concluded that Zika infections in in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies.</p> <p>The World Health Organization has said there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults.</p> <p>The connection between Zika and microcephaly first came to light last autumn in Brazil, which has now confirmed more than 1,100 cases of microcephaly that it considers to be related to Zika infections in the mothers.</p> <p>For Scott, a hectic playing schedule from mid-June until the end of August was his biggest cause for concern.</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing I&#8217;ve ever aspired to do and I don&#8217;t think I ever will,&#8221; world number seven Scott told Reuters last year. &#8220;It&#8217;s all about the four majors and I think that&#8217;s the way it should stay for golf.&#8221;</p> <p>The Rio Olympics takes place from Aug. 5 to Aug. 21.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2764436&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: USA Today) <p>By the time Louis Oosthuizen reached the 16th tee box at the Masters on Sunday, holes-in-one were a dime a dozen.</p> <p>So, Oosthuizen gave &#8217;em an ace with a kiss.</p> <p>The South African joined Shane Lowry and Davis Love III in the hole-in-one club at 16 but put his own special spin on it. Oosthuizen&#8217;s tee shot landed to the right of the hole, trickled down the slope, then caressed off the ball that J.B. Holmes had hit onto the green moments earlier.</p> <p>The ricochet pushed Oosthuizen&#8217;s shot to the right, then the ball redirected &#8211; straight into the hole. It&#8217;s the first time there have been three holes-in-one on the same hole in the same Masters &#8211; let alone the same day at the Masters.</p> <blockquote class="twitter-video"> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Watch <a href="http://twitter.com/Louis57TM">@Louis57TM</a> make a hole-in-one off J.B. Holmes golf ball on No. 16 <a href="http://twitter.com/hashtag/themasters?src=hash">#themasters</a> <a href="http://t.co/gQUlT7t62K">http://t.co/gQUlT7t62K</a></p> <p>— Masters Tournament (@TheMasters) <a href="http://twitter.com/TheMasters/status/719270992401412096">10 April 2016</a></p></blockquote> <p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s a place where you want to make a long putt or a chip or something like that, that&#8217;s where you want to do it,&#8221; Oosthuizen said.</p> <p>Seemed like everyone had that idea Sunday.</p> <p>Early in the day, with the stands already full in the amphitheater setting on 16, Lowry knocked one in for the 16th ace to be recorded on the hole called &#8220;Redbud.&#8221; Fans roared. He high-fived playing partner Patrick Reed. The fans went wild.</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll put that picture up in my house and it will be a nice memento to have,&#8221; Lowry said.</p> <p>An hour or so later, Love framed one, too, and picked up the crystal bowl that goes to anyone who makes an ace at the year&#8217;s first major. It was the fourth time there had been two holes-in-one on the same hole in the same round at the Masters.</p> <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t ever remember coming that close,&#8221; Love said. &#8220;I made some 2s.&#8221;</p> <p>Yes, he has.</p> <p>Six years before Tiger Woods chipped in from the fringe on No. 16 &#8211; the shot that barely trickled over the lip and sparked Verne Lundquist&#8217;s &#8220;In Your Life?&#8221; call in 2005 &#8211; Love hit almost the exact same shot to make a 2.</p> <p>The 16th hole is always set up for drama on Sundays.</p> <p>&#8220;But you still have to get a good shot,&#8221; Holmes said.</p> <p>He did, too.</p> <p>His tee shot stopped about 5 feet from the hole before Oosthuizen&#8217;s shot displaced it. Holmes replaced his ball, as is called for in the Rules of Golf, and made birdie. No biggie on this day.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Oosthuizen&#8217;s film reel grows.</p> <p>On Sunday in 2012, he holed out from 253 yards away in the fairway on the par-5 second hole for a double-eagle 2. It gave him the lead, and conjured memories of the shot that put the Masters on the map: the double-eagle on 15 by Gene Sarazen that propelled him to a victory in 1935.</p> <p>Oosthuizen finished runner-up back then, and was well out of the running this time. He finished at 3 over and was packing up by the time the leaders reached the hole where he made history.</p> <p>&#8220;The &#8216;2,&#8217; that was really nice,&#8221; Oosthuizen said. &#8220;But today, I went from being really down, not having a good day in perfect conditions, and to do that, it&#8217;s a big lifter.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2748779&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: USA Today Sports) <p>Indian golfer Anirban Lahiri was pulled back by a disastrous front-nine but still managed to better his previous best by signing off tied 42nd with a three-over 75 in the final round of the 80th Masters Tournament here.</p> <p>Lahiri ended with a total of 11-over 299 to finish tied 42nd and better his previous best of T-49 last year.</p> <p>Lahiri, starting the day at five-over and in tied-38th place, courted disaster on the third with a triple bogey and had further bogeys on fourth and seventh.</p> <p>But he played his last 11 holes superbly with two birdies and rest of them pars to finish with 75.</p> <p>&#8220;The two triples (one each on first and last days) and not being able to score off the Par-fives cost me something like 10 shots and that is the difference being in Top-10 or somewhere in the 40s. That should explain it all. I played well in patches and that was not enough,&#8221; Lahiri said.</p> <p>Lahiri is planning to take two weeks off and practice with his coach, Vijay Divecha, who arrived over the weekend.</p> <p>&#8220;I want to a few chores around the house, as we settle into a new place in Florida, which will be my base for next few months,&#8221; said Lahiri.</p> <p>&#8220;Also I need to work on my game and will get back to tournaments in two weeks time at New Orleans.&#8221;</p> <p>Asian Tour&#8217;s Kiradech Aphibarnrat added a two-under 70 in the final round of the Masters to finish Tied 15th, his best ever result in a Major event.</p> <p>Thongchai Jaidee, playing his fifth Masters, had another frustrating with a six-over 78 that saw him finish the week at 19-over and in Tied-57th place.</p> <p>Kiradech had rounds of 72-72-77-70. His previous best at any Major was T25 on debut at the 2013 PGA Championship. Overall, Kiradech scored heavily on Par-fives, where he was nine-under with one eagle and nine birdies and two bogeys.</p> <p>Ahead on the top of the leaderboard, Danny Willett, playing in fourth from last group shot one of the three scores of 67 on Sunday to catapult from Tied-8th to the very top.</p> <p>He finished more than half an hour earlier than defending champion Jordan Spieth to finish and won by three over fellow Englishman Lee Westwood (69) and Spieth (73).</p> <p>For Willett it meant a first major and it was only his second appearance, having finished Tied-38th last year. Willett, who also won the Dubai Classic this year, is 28 and a former World No.1 amateur.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2748368&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: USA Today Sports) <p>Danny Willett&#8217;s Masters victory was built on the back of a steady display in every facet of the game, rather than outright brilliance in any one area.</p> <p>Willett has a very repeatable swing that more often than not stands up under the heat of being in contention.</p> <p>&#8220;He has a very strong action, repeatable with good shot shape and has a very good understanding of his own swing,&#8221; Ian Baker-Finch, a former British Open champion who was part of the CBS commentary team at Augusta, told Reuters.</p> <p>Willett is no slouch off the tee, but his driving distance average of 279 yards at the Masters was 20 yards less than category leader Dustin Johnson.</p> <p>He also found 38 of 56 fairways, eight less than category leaders Matt Kuchar and Kevin Streelman, so he was certainly not the most accurate player off the tee.</p> <p>He hit 48 out of 72 greens in regulation, perhaps the most relevant of Masters statistics, six behind leader Matthew Fitzpatrick.</p> <p>And once he reached the green, Willett displayed a steady touch with the putter, taking just 114 strokes on the greens, four more than leader Anirban Lahiri.</p> <p>He had just one three-putt as he ran up 13 birdies, to go along with eight bogeys.</p> <p>Joint runner-up Jordan Spieth, by contrast, had 22 birdies, 10 bogeys, three doubles and a quad. Spieth three-putted four times.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2748289&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

<img class="wp-image-2748276 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/jordan-spieth-m1.jpg" alt="" /> Jordan Speith imploded with a bogey-bogey start to the back nine followed by a quadruple-bogey 7 at the 12th. (Source: AP) <p>World number one Jason Day was &#8220;absolutely shocked&#8221; while Lee Westwood pointed to the fine line between success and disaster at the Masters after Jordan Spieth&#8217;s astonishing collapse in Sunday&#8217;s final round.</p> <p>American Spieth, seeking a second consecutive victory at Augusta National and a third major title, was five strokes ahead before he imploded with a bogey-bogey start to the back nine followed by a quadruple-bogey 7 at the 12th.</p> <p>Though he covered the last six holes in one-under, he had effectively handed the Green Jacket to Englishman Danny Willett as he finished three shots back in a tie for second place, leaving the fans and his fellow players in stunned disbelief.</p> <p>&#8220;I was on (hole) 15 and I was absolutely shocked when I saw Jordan go from five (under) to one (under),&#8221; Australian Day said after closing with a one-over 73 to share 10th place. &#8220;It&#8217;s tough. It&#8217;s tough to win major championships.</p> <p>&#8220;So many things and emotions, so many things go through your mind. Sometimes you just don&#8217;t feel comfortable on certain shots. And unfortunately he hit a bad shot and another bad shot.&#8221;</p> <p>Spieth&#8217;s worst damaging moments came at the par-three 12th where he hit successive shots into the waters of Rae&#8217;s Creek in front of the green before finding a back bunker with his fifth en route to a mind-boggling seven.</p> <p>&#8220;Right now it&#8217;s unfortunate and I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s killing himself for it,&#8221; Day, who clinched his first major victory at last year&#8217;s PGA Championship, said of a player known for his mental strength.</p> <p>&#8220;But we all do it to ourselves. Hopefully he just learns from it and gets better.</p> <p>&#8220;You go out and lead for seven rounds at Augusta, he&#8217;s done a fantastic job,&#8221; added Day, referring to Spieth&#8217;s achievement in holding the outright Masters lead for a record seven consecutive rounds until his meltdown on Sunday.</p> <p>Like Day, England&#8217;s former world number one Westwood first became aware of Spieth&#8217;s stunning collapse while he was playing the par-five 15th.</p> <p>&#8220;I saw the leaderboard when I chipped in on 15,&#8221; said the 42-year-old. &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t really looked much until that stage.</p> <p>&#8220;There was a massive scoreboard out there and a lot of &#8216;oohs&#8217; and &#8216;aahs&#8217;. It happens around here. There is a fine line here between success and disaster on this golf course.&#8221;</p> <p>For PGA Tour rookie Smylie Kaufman, who played with Spieth in the final pairing, it &#8220;just kind of stunk&#8221; to watch his fellow American&#8217;s collapse.</p> <p>&#8220;I was really cheering for Jordan as a buddy, and it&#8217;s unfortunate what happened &#8230; just kind of a weird day for both of us,&#8221; said Kaufman, who struggled to an 81 to end his first Masters appearance.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2748247&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

Danny Willett became the second Englishman ever to win the Augusta Masters - 20 years after Nick Faldo wore the green jacket.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2748037&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

<img class="wp-image-2748297 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/danny-w-m.jpg" alt="" /> Danny Willett won the 80th edition of Augusta Masters on Sunday with a three stoke lead over defending champion Jordan Spieth. (Source: AP) <p>Danny Willett in a green jacket was hard to believe considering he wasn&#8217;t even sure he could play the Masters two weeks ago.</p> <p>Jordan Spieth was even more stunned.</p> <p>Nine holes away from history, the defending Masters champion threw it all away in a collapse around Amen Corner that was shocking even by Augusta National standards. He played the opening three holes of the back nine in 6 over par, including a quadruple bogey at the 12th.</p> <p>Willet, five shots behind with six holes left to play, birdied three of his last six holes to polish off a round that might not get its due because of Spieth&#8217;s meltdown. He closed with a 5-under 67, with no bogeys on his card, to match the best score of the weekend.</p> <p>The 28-year-old Englishman wasn&#8217;t even planning to play. His wife was due with their first child on this very day. Their son, Zachariah James, was born on March 30, clearing Willett to a most unlikely path to becoming a major champion.</p> <p>Willett won in his second Masters, ending Europe&#8217;s 17-year drought at Augusta National, and he became the first player from England to win the green jacket since Nick Faldo in 1996.</p> <p>How fitting. Faldo also shot 67 that day in a final round remembered more for Greg Norman throwing away a six-shot lead.</p> <p>Spieth, trying to become the first player in history to win wire-to-wire in a major in successive years, ran off four straight birdies to end the front nine and build a five-shot lead.</p> <p>And then it all fell apart.</p> <p>A bogey from the bunker on No. 10. A tee shot into the trees on No. 11 that led to another bogey. Willett made birdie on the 14th to get within one shot. Spieth only needed to get past the dangerous par-3 12th hole to settle himself, especially with two par 5s in front of him.</p> <p>Instead, his tee shot bounced off the slope and into the water. From the drop zone, his wedge was fat and Spieth turned his head. He didn&#8217;t even look as it plopped into the water again. He made a quadruple-bogey 7.</p> <p>On the 10th tee, Spieth was five shots ahead. On the 13th tee, he was three shots behind.</p> <p>Spieth still had a chance when he birdied both par 5s to get within two shots with three to play. But he missed an 8-foot birdie putt on the 16th, and his bogey from the bunker ended all hope. He closed with a 73 and tied for second with Lee Westwood (69).</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2748037&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

-footer dropped for birdie on Par-4 seventh. (Source: USA Today Sports) <p>Indian golfing ace Anirban Lahiri grinded it out on yet another tough scoring day in challenging conditions to card a three-over 75 in the third round and move up to Tied 38th at the Masters, in Georgia.</p> <p>High winds, which changed direction suddenly, pushed the average score to more than four shots over Augusta National’s par and played to just over 76, more than a shot more difficult than the second day.</p> <p>That meant Lahiri despite his over par score actually made ground and moved up from overnight Tied-47th.</p> <p>Lahiri’s 75 took him to eight-over 224 and he is now 11 shots off the leader, Jordan Spieth (73).</p> <p>At the top, too, there was mayhem but Spieth held on to the lead for the seventh successive round at the Masters dating back to the first round of the 2015 edition.</p> <p>He had a four-shot lead when he came off the 16th green, but a bogey on 17th and then a double bogey on 18th saw him fall back.</p> <p>Smylie Kaufman, a PGA Tour rookie, shot the best round of the day at three-under 69 the first round in 60s since Thursday, to be sole second at two-under 214, while veteran Bernhard Langer (70) was tied third with Hideki Matsuyama (72), who also dropped two bogeys in last three holes.</p> <p>The 58-year-old Langer, who could become the oldest Major winner ever, won the second of his two Masters in 1993, which was before the 22-year-old Spieth was born, while Kaufman, 24, was 16 months old and Matsuyama, 24, was 10 months old.</p> <p><strong>READ: <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/golf/jordan-spieth-stays-top-at-masters-despite-late-stumble/">Jordan Spieth stays top at Masters despite late stumble</a></strong></p> <p>Coming back to Lahiri, he had two birdies, first on the Par-5 second and the next on Par-4 seventh, besides five bogeys. He bogeyed first, third and fifth and then 15th and 16th.</p> <p>The stretch between 15-17 has cost Lahiri no less than seven shots in the last three days.</p> <p>&#8220;Well, I played good and shot three-over and I had three three-putts, so it is not as if I played badly. On the contrary, I think I played quite well. I just did not score and didn’t get the putts to fall,&#8221; Lahiri said.</p> <p>Lahiri likened the toughness to a school examination, saying, &#8220;It’s like writing an exam. For four and a half hours you have to just grind it out. At no point can you let up even a moment. It is really difficult conditions out there.&#8221;</p> <p>Saying the course did not give anything and one needed to be patient, he added, &#8220;Through this week, I have played well enough for 13-14 holes and then had a weak finish and given away a lot of shots each day. It can be mentally exhausting when you have to check so many things like lie, ball flight, wind, when it is changing and so many things, so it is like being in a Brain Gym all the time. There is no option but to be patient.&#8221;</p> <p>Lahiri did have a massive high when his 40-footer dropped for birdie on Par-4 seventh.</p> <p>&#8220;That 40-footer on the seventh was a bit of a bonus. It was one of those things, when you are trying to lag the putt for a two-putt and it just went in,&#8221; he said.</p> <p>That incidentally was one of the toughest holes on Saturday.</p> <p>Though Lahiri did have one birdie off a par-five (the second), he said, &#8220;I have not scored off the par-fives the way I should have. He has had just one birdie on a par-five in three rounds and dropped three bogeys.&#8221;</p> <p>If Spieth wins, he will be the first player to win back-to-back Masters since Tiger Woods (2001-2002) and if Langer wins he would be the oldest and in case the title goes to Matsuyama, he will be the first Asian to do so.</p> <p>And if Kaufman emerges as the man with the Green Jacket, he will be the first-timer wearing it since Fuzzy Zoeller in 1979.</p> <p>However, with Jason Day, Danny Willett and Dustin Johnson packed together at even par, and Soren Kjeldsen, Brandt Snedeker and Lee Westwood clubbed together at one-over, no less than 10 players are within four shots off the lead.</p> <p>And yes, Rory McIlroy (77) is tied 11th with Daniel Berger (74) at two-over, which means five behind Spieth.</p> <p>Of the other two Asian Tour stars, Kiradech Aphibarnrat (77) slipped up right at the end and Thongchai Jaidee (81) was totally off colour in the third round.</p> <p>Kiradech, who was in sight of a top-10, dropped from overnight Tied-8th to Tied-23rd after a closing double bogey on 18th.</p> <p>Thongchai, the highest ranked among the Asian Trio, was battered by the brutal weather and ended with nine-over 81 that had seven bogeys and a double on the closing hole the 18th.</p> <p>He fell from Tied-42nd to Tied-54th and he 13-over for the tournament.</p> <p>Just like the first day, Kiradech had four bogeys on the front nine on first, fifth, sixth and eighth.</p> <p>But this time there was no recovery on the backstretch.</p> <p>He bogeyed 10th to go five-over.</p> <p>Birdies on 13th and 14th suggested a revival, but a double bogey on 18th ended those hopes.</p> <p>Kiradech said, &#8220;The weather conditions and wind were very tough and also the pin position was not easy at all. Maybe I can improve my position on Sunday. I have enjoyed the Masters and hopefully I will try to be back again.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2747472&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

The third round began with the spotlight firmly on, Jordan Spieth and McIlroy forming one of the most anticipated final pairings ever.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2747010&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(USA Today Sports) <p>Jordan Spieth withstood heavy winds and even stiffer challenges to remain atop the Masters leaderboard, and will take a one-shot lead into Sunday&#8217;s final round as he bids to complete a successful defence of his Green Jacket.</p> <p>The 22-year-old Texan has now held the outright lead for a record seven consecutive rounds and if he can hold on for one more day will join Tiger Woods, Nick Faldo and Jack Nicklaus as the only men to claim back-to-back Masters wins.</p> <p>Spieth, who began the third round with a one-shot advantage, ended it in the same position after a wild afternoon at a windswept Augusta National, carding a one-over 73 that featured two double-bogeys on the back nine, including one at the 18th.</p> <p>An 80th Masters that had looked ready to turn into a coronation with Spieth holding a four-stroke edge with two to play but will instead be up for grabs with an eclectic mix of challengers, including a Masters debutant, a 58-year-old former champion and a 24-year-old Japanese sensation all lurking.</p> <p>American rookie Smylie Kaufman, who still lives with his parents, had the lowest round of the day, returning a three-under 69 to join Spieth in an unlikely final pairing.</p> <p>&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t a fun last couple holes to play from the position I was in,&#8221; said Spieth, who also had a bogey at 17 to surrender three shots over his last two holes.</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not going to be fun tonight for a little while, and hopefully I just sleep it off and it&#8217;s fine tomorrow. I imagine that will be the case. It was tough.&#8221;</p> <p>Sitting two off the pace is evergreen German Bernhard Langer, a two-time Masters winner who showed he still knows how to get around a tricky Augusta layout, carding a two-under 70, and Hideki Matsuyama, playing in his fifth Masters, who had 72.</p> <p>Australian world number one Jason Day, the pre-Masters favourite who struggled to find consistent form through the early rounds, finally emerged as a contender as he rocketed up the leaderboard with a 71 to finish three shots off the pace.</p> <p>The third round began with the spotlight firmly on two of golf&#8217;s charismatic young guns, Spieth and McIlroy forming one of the most anticipated final pairings ever featured at the year&#8217;s first major.</p> <p>Tracked by massive galleries, the dynamic duo had all the credentials of an all-star pairing with the Texan and the Northern Irishman having claimed four of the last six major championships played.</p> <p>But the marquee matchup failed to deliver on the promised suspence as Spieth held firm and McIlroy quickly faded, slumping to a five-over 77 to fall five strokes back and leave his bid for a career grand slam on thin ice.</p> <p>Instead it was Langer, Matsuyama and Kaufman who stole the show with masterful displays of golf in challenging conditions.</p> <p>Kaufman, level with six to play, produced a sizzling finish as he drained birdie putts at the 13th, 14th and 16th.</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m driving the ball really well right now and if I&#8217;m going to get on the greens just as much as everybody else, I think that I&#8217;ll have a pretty good opportunity to be in contention,&#8221; said Kaufman.</p> <p>&#8220;That was the goal coming into the week, just get in contention. And now that I&#8217;m here &#8230; kind of re-adjust the goals a little bit and try to win tomorrow.&#8221;</p> <p>Langer, who won both his Masters titles before Spieth was born, also made a stirring late charge with three consecutive birdies from the 13th.</p> <p>He gave one back at the last but will still enter Sunday with a chance to become the oldest ever major winner and take the torch from American Julius Boros, who was a full decade younger when he won the PGA Championship at age 48.</p> <p>&#8220;I believe I can,&#8221; declared Langer, when asked if he can win a third Masters. &#8220;If I play my best, I can shoot four-or-five under tomorrow &#8230; but so can Jordan Spieth.</p> <p>&#8220;I said earlier on, sooner or later, it&#8217;s going to happen. One of the over 50s is going to win a major.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2747010&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

ill play his third round alongside two-time Major winner, Martin Kaymer of Germany, who shot 74-75. (Source: USA today Sports) <p>Anirban Lahiri battled tough weather conditions and somewhat inconsistent breaks in the second round as he made the cut for the weekend at the prestigious Augusta Masters.</p> <p>The Indian ace made the cut at T-47th. Lahiri, who shot four-over 76 in the first round, began well to be two-under through 12 holes, before three bogeys pulled him down to one-over 73 and a total of five-over 149.</p> <p>At that stage, he was in danger of missing the cut, which looked likely at four-over 148.</p> <p>However, as conditions worsened with gusty winds going upwards 20-25 miles per hour, scores began to drop and the cut finally fell at six-over 150, giving Lahiri a chance to improve upon his previous best of T-49 achieved on his debut last year.</p> <p>Lahiri will play his third round alongside two-time Major winner, Martin Kaymer of Germany, who shot 74-75.</p> <p>Fans dreaming of a Jordan Spieth v Rory McIlroy clash on Sunday will get it a day early, as Spieth stayed in lead at four-under for the sixth consecutive round at the Masters, going back to the first round of 2015 editions.</p> <p>Meanwhile McIlroy seeking the only Major he does not possess, is at three-under.</p> <p>Between the two they experienced highs and lows if McIlroy dropped from four-under to even par and then again rose to three-under by the finish, Spieth at one time was five clear of the field, but by the end was just one ahead of McIlroy.</p> <p>Spieth&#8217;s sudden drop also gave Bubba Watson a chance to redeem himself after twos 75s, as he made the cut on the basis of being 10 or less off the lead, apart from the Top-50 and ties.</p> <p>Lahiri was happy to have gotten another chance, but disappointed at the way his scoring went in the second round.</p> <p>He said,&#8221;It was like swimming against the tide. I don&#8217;t think I did much wrong. It was just that things didn&#8217;t go my way. On the 13th approach, I caught the gust and it went over, and on the 15th, I played for the wind, but it went through and over. In both cases I ended with bogeys.</p> <p>&#8220;I just didn&#8217;t score on the Par-fives, it is something that I need to work on.&#8221;</p> <p>He added,&#8221;I putted better on the front nine, than the back nine. On 16 and 17 I missed something like eight-footers. I have not played badly, but I have been able to score better, missing all those 8-10 footers.</p> <p>&#8220;Still with the wind blowing, I think the scoring is going to be tough, so let&#8217;s if five-over makes it. I really want to stay on.&#8221;</p> <p>At that time, he was still not sure as many of the players had not come in.</p> <p>As things finally turned out, Lahiri did make the cut, which fell at six-over.</p> <p>Lahiri, who dropped four shots in two holes – 16th and 17th – on the first day during his 76, had a great start on Friday, but once again had a rough finish.</p> <p>With conditions calmer in the morning, he birdied the sixth holing a 14-foot birdie.</p> <p>On the fifth, he holed an evenbigger putt from 23 feet to go two-under, as the winds started picking up.</p> <p>A bogey on the fifth when he failed to get to the green in regulation saw him drop back.</p> <p>A great drive followed by a superb approach on 11th set him up for a five-foot birdie, which he duly nailed.</p> <p>But for the second day running, he struggled at the finish with bogeys on 13th, 15th and 17th to finish at 73 and five-over for the tournament.</p> <p>Spieth, who started the day at six-under, went to eight under with birdies on first and third, while others were either still standing where they were or slipping back as wind started picking up.</p> <p>Then Spieth, too, began to struggle.</p> <p>He dropped a double bogey on fifth, where very uncharacteristically he four-putted.</p> <p>Two more bogeys on ninth and 10th, and another two on 16th and 17th saw him come down the greased pole.</p> <p>Birdies on eighth and 15th limited the damage, but he slipped to four-under.</p> <p>McIlroy starting from two-under added birdies on second and third to move to four-under.</p> <p>But from there, he slipped to one-under with a double on fourth and a bogey on fifth.</p> <p>That deteriorated to even par with another bogey on 11th.</p> <p>Yet, as only McIlroy can, he picked up pieces with three birdies on 13th, 15th and 16th to get to three-under and give himself another chance at the only Major missing in his cabinet.</p> <p>Spieth is bidding to accomplish the rare feat of winning back-to-back Green Jackets, something done only three times &#8211; by Jack Nicklaus (1965-66), Nick Faldo (1989-1990) and Tiger Woods (2001-2002).</p> <p>While the rule of Top-50 and ties would have seen only 56 players, Spieth&#8217;s drop to four-under gave Bubba a new lease of life for the weekend, under the rule of “10 shots off the lead&#8217;.</p> <p>Had Spieth missed the last 15-footer and come down to three-under, even those at seven-over would have made it and it would have included former Masters champions Phil Mickelson and Trevor Immelman.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2745720&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: PTI) <p>The International Hockey Federation (FIH) on Monday announced a new annual global home and away league, to be launched in 2019 involving the world&#8217;s leading hockey nations, which will replace Hockey World League (HWL) Semi-Finals and Finals and the Champions Trophy.</p> <p>FIH also decided that Champions Trophy held once in two years since 1978 will be scrapped and the 2018 edition in Amsterdam will be the last tournament.</p> <p>&#8220;Designed to provide a regular calendar of must-see events played in packed stadia across the world throughout the year, a new annual global home and away league involving the world&#8217;s leading hockey nations will complement the Hockey World Cup and Olympic Games tournaments,&#8221; FIH said in a statement.</p> <p>&#8220;This system will see international teams play against opponents once at home and once away each year in this league. Following several months of competition, the top ranked teams will then qualify for a stand-alone grand finale tournament which will determine the winners of the competition. This will form part of a three tier system, identical for both the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s game,&#8221; it added.</p> <p>Teams participating in the new home and away league will be chosen based on a clearly defined set of qualification criteria designed to maintain the quality of the league and high standard events.</p> <p>&#8220;These have been developed around the three main objectives of the new event portfolio &#8212; to generate a massive change in TV and media coverage for hockey; create big, bold, packed and loud events and make a step change to increase future revenues,&#8221; FIH stated.</p> <p>For those nations not in the home and away league, the next tier of competition will remain similar to the current Hockey World League Round 1 and 2 events, played over two year cycles.</p> <p>This format will still gives teams the chance to go all the way to the World Cup or Olympics. Even the smallest hockey-playing nations have the opportunity to write their own chapter in hockey&#8217;s history books as they progress throughout the rounds of competition into these flagship events.</p> <p>While Hockey World Cup qualification will remain similar to the current system, Olympic qualification will change, pending approval of the International Olympic Committee&#8217;s Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games qualification criteria.</p> <p>These proposals were approved by the FIH Executive Board in Lausanne, Switzerland earlier this month. The decision was made after more than 18 months of consultation, research and development between a number of stakeholders, overseen by a specially formed working group for this project.</p> <p>&#8220;This is a historic decision for the sport of hockey a game changer! More than a year&#8217;s worth of work and over 700 people have helped develop this new portfolio of events. Moving from a tournament based format to a home and away league will considerably increase the value of our sport,&#8221; said FIH CEO Kelly Fairweather.</p> <p>&#8220;Fans will be exposed to more international hockey throughout the year, with many more home matches for them to enjoy. This, along with tweaks to the tiers below, will have a significant impact on the sport across all levels, safeguarding its future for many years to come,&#8221; he added.</p> <p>FIH President Leandro Negre said the changes were made with an aim of making hockey a global game.</p> <p>&#8220;When we launched our strategy 18 months ago we knew that drastic measures were required to revolutionise the sport. This is an exciting opportunity for hockey. A lot of hard work has already been undertaken, but this is only the start.</p> <p>&#8220;We need the hockey family to embrace this change now to ensure we reach our 10-year aim of making hockey a global game that inspires the next generation. This will certainly be a monumental step for the sport as we take it to the next level,&#8221; said Negre.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2759329&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

India hockey team's performance over the last one week at the Azlan Shah Cup gave a glimpse into the team's preparation for Rio 2016.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2758084&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

team but came up with encouraging performances. <p>From the start, this wasn&#8217;t about the result. India have traditionally done well at the Azlan Shah Cup. But a podium finish at the invitational tournament did little else apart from giving the coach, players and the followers a false sense of security. This time, though, it was different. With Olympics just three months away, coach Roelant Oltmans decided to use the tournament to test a few players and identify back-ups for some positions. And although India were humbled, yet again, by Australia in the final, the performance over the last one week gave a glimpse into the team&#8217;s preparation for the Rio Games this August. <em><a href="http://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a></em> looks at a few takeaways for team India:</p> <p><strong>No back-up for Sreejesh</strong></p> <p>You almost felt sorry for Harjot Singh when he started the final against Australia on the bench. For nearly two years, he has played second fiddle to PR Sreejesh and when his opportunity came to be the lead goalkeeper, he was eventually overtaken by a young and untested Akash Chikte. However, Harjot has only himself to blame. With Oltmans opting to rest Sreejesh to give the back-up goalie an opportunity, you would have expected Harjot to be up for the task and prove that he is the worthy successor.</p> <p>But as the week wore on, his performance showed why all coaches in the last two years (Terry Walsh, Paul van Ass and now Oltmans) have been reluctant to give Sreejesh a break even for one match and play him in the goal instead. He was indecisive, careless and too casual in the goal, getting beaten far too often on his near post and wasn&#8217;t brave enough &#8211; a trait that sets Sreejesh apart. Between Harjot and Chikte, India conceded 15 goals in seven matches including the final. It can be argued that the defence in front of them wasn&#8217;t the strongest, but there were several occasions where they could&#8217;ve done better.</p> <p>Even Oltmans, who generally does not pick on players individually, did not seem happy with Harjot&#8217;s approach. &#8220;He casually gave away the penalty corner. I took Harjot off the pitch because of this careless act,&#8221; Oltmans said after the match against Canada. &#8220;That&#8217;s just unacceptable.&#8221; If India&#8217;s intent was to look for Sreejesh&#8217;s back-up, the tournament has produced more questions than answers.</p> <p><strong>Drag-flick dilemma</strong></p> <p>Harmanpreet Singh has been making waves in the junior international circuit for quite some time with his powerful, accurate drag-flicks and slick defending. Whether he would hold his own in the rough and quick-paced senior level was a question on many a mind. And going by what we saw over the last seven days, Harmanpreet does look the real deal. He looked threatening every time he stood on top of the &#8216;D&#8217; to take a drag-flick and looked assured and composed in the defence as well. His performance would give Oltmans a headache when it comes to selecting drag-flickers for the Olympics, and it wouldn&#8217;t be a surprise if he puts pressure on VR Raghunath and Rupinderpal Singh for a spot in the squad.</p> <p>Oltmans selected an experimental squad for the tournament, with the average age of the side being 23.5 years, and he would have been satisfied with what he saw. Harjeet Singh, playing his maiden international tournament, impressed in bits but considering that he prefers playing as a centre-half &#8211; a position Sardar Singh and Manpreet Singh generally occupy &#8211; he was largely overshadowed by the duo. But the junior India captain made most of his opportunities, also scoring his maiden India goal during the tournament. Surender Singh and Chikte, the other two junior players who were given a chance, didn&#8217;t do much wrong but didn&#8217;t do anything spectacular either that would have grabbed Oltmans&#8217; attention.</p> <p><strong>Nikkin, Ramandeep and goals</strong></p> <p>Nikkin Thimmaiah is perhaps the most under-rated players in the team. He works his socks off and is selfless, a kind of player any coach would want in his team. A shoulder injury sidelined him for quite some time and playing in his first international tournament since recovering, Nikkin&#8217;s return boosted the forward line, giving them a much-needed edge. He combined well along with the perennially misfiring SV Sunil, Talwinder Singh and Ramandeep Singh, who too came up with some opportunistic strikes in this tournament.</p> <p>India scored 18 goals in the tournament, second-most in the seven-nation tournament after Australia. Their form bodes well for India, considering that Akashdeep Singh, Lalit Upadhyay and Devinder Walmiki will make their way into the squad. It is a young and energetic attack line-up, although positioning inside the box and ball control still remains below par. With a little more coordination and finesse, Oltmans could have found solutions to India&#8217;s field goals problems.</p> <p><strong>Sunil relishes responsibility</strong></p> <p>A captain has few responsibilities on a field. And the vice-captain has fewer. But SV Sunil seemed to relish the responsibility of being Sardar Singh&#8217;s deputy during the tournament. He played with a lot of self-control and involved others in the game more often rather than just dashing forward using his blinding pace in the hope that his teammates would catch up him. He scored goals too with some deft touches, reminding us of what he is capable of.<br /> At the same time, India showed that they still rely heavily on Sardar and Manpreet Singh to hold the midfield. Manpreet missed the first two matches after he lost his father just before the tournament began. In his absence, Sardar looked overworked. And even though the skipper isn&#8217;t the same player that he used to be a couple of years ago, he remains the creative outlet. Worryingly for India, when both players had an off day &#8211; against New Zealand &#8211; it affected the overall performance, and eventually they lost the match 2-1.</p> <p><strong>Tougher opponents</strong></p> <p>That brings us to the last and perhaps one of the most important points. Apart from the lowly Canada, India could not manage to beat the two other Rio-bound teams. The defeat to New Zealand, and the twin losses to Australia, exposed a lot of chinks in India&#8217;s armour, most of all the fragile defence. When put under pressure, the midfield gave up and the back line looked hopelessly out of sorts.</p> <p>India can argue that they were playing an experimental side. But Australia, too, had their own problems. The world champions came to Malaysia with just 16 players, two less than all other teams, to acclimatise themselves to the Olympics rules. They played the final without their two key men &#8211; Jamie Dwyer and Chris Cirello were both nursing minor injuries &#8211; which reduced their outfield playing options to just 12. To play in Malaysian humidity for an hour with a just dozen players is a huge challenge but Australia showed their superior fitness by systematically dismantling India.</p> <p>And New Zealand&#8230; Well, they are a team that made it to the Olympics only because South Africa decided not to send theirs. Losing to them is no shame but it would give Oltmans a lot to ponder over. There were many takeaways for India. But with Olympics a little more than 100 days away, what would bother them is the inability to beat top teams when they&#8217;re playing full throttle with their first-choice players.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2758084&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

h title win as they continued their stranglehold over the tournament. <p>India suffered a 0-4 drubbing at the hands of world champions Australia to settle for a silver medal, their best finish in six years, in the 25th Sultan Azlan Shah Cup hockey tournament on Saturday.</p> <p>This was Australia&#8217;s ninth title win as they continued their stranglehold over the tournament. India last won the tournament in 2010, their fifth title, when they were jointly declared winners with South Korea. In 2012 and 2015 they were the bronze medallists.</p> <p>Thomas Craig and Matt Ghodes scored two goals each in open field play for Australia to overwhelm India after a stout defence in the first quarter had denied the world&#8217;s top-ranked team a good shot at the Indian citadel.</p> <p>Australia took off though Craig&#8217;s field goals in the 25th and 35th minutes, but the Indians seemed to be tiring when Ghodes scored struck twice in the 43rd and 57th minutes.</p> <p>Australia, who won all their seven matches in style, had thumped India 5-1 in the round-robin league encounter.</p> <p>Australia&#8217;s triumph earned them their ninth title in the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup. For India, this was the second time they finished with the silver medal in seven final appearances.</p> <p>Playing to a plan at the beginning, India managed to keep the Australians away from their citadel in the first quarter and even managed to break into the rival circle on two occasions. Australia forced one penalty corner that was fired wide of the mark by Jeremy Hayward.</p> <p>At the other end, a cross from Chinglensana Singh on the right was deflected wide off the mark by Chandana Thimmaiah.</p> <p>Frustrated for 25 minutes, Australia broke the deadlock when Craig picked up a diagonal ball in the goalmouth and moved sidewards before slamming the ball into the boards.</p> <p>Australia earned another penalty corner before Indian striker Ramandeep Singh featured in the last move before half-time. Ramandeep&#8217;s shy from the top of the circle in a crowded scoring zone was easily deflected out.</p> <p>Thimmaiah had another shot at the goal from close range in the first minute of the second half, but sent the feeble push straight to goalkeeper Andrew Charter.</p> <p>India were awarded their first penalty corner in the 32nd minute when striker SV Sunil was obstructed on top of the circle, but Harmanpreet Singh&#8217;s shot posed little threat as the custodian blocked it with his pads.</p> <p>Craig increased Australia&#8217;s lead with an outstanding goal in the 35th minute when he dived to deflect a cross from Blake Govers into the right corner of the goal.</p> <p>India came close to pulling a goal back in the 40th minute during a goalmouth scrimmage, but Chris Ciriello pulled the ball pack from the goalline after it had gone past the goalkeeper.</p> <p>This was followed by two two successive penalty corners for India, but Rupinder Pal Singh was not able to shoot past Charter, the Australian custodian.</p> <p>Ghodes put the game out of India&#8217;s reach by scoring the third Australian goal in a goalmouth melee in the 43rd minute when goalkeeper Akash Chikte palmed a ball from the left, but it deflected to Ghodes.</p> <p>Mandeep Singh could have entered his name in the scoresheet, but his try off Talwinder Singh&#8217;s pass went wide of the right post.</p> <p>Last year&#8217;s champions New Zealand claimed the bronze medal by overcoming the challenge from hosts Malaysia 5-4 in the penalty shootout after the two teams were tied 3-3 in regulation period.</p> <p>It was a 59th-minute equaliser that revived New Zealand, who had trailed from the seventh minute when Ramadan Rosli scored a field goal.</p> <p>Fitri Saari increased the lead with another open play strike in the 11th minute. The Black Sticks pulled a goal back in opne field play three minutes before half-time when Hayden Phillips found the target.</p> <p>New Zealand drew 2-2 parity in the 43rd minute on kane Russell&#8217;s penalty corner conversion, but Shahril Saabah&#8217;s flash strike against put Malaysia ahead within a minute.</p> <p>Malaysia enjoyed the lead until the 59th minute, but going all out to score another goal allowed New Zealand a counter-attack that resulted in a penalty corner.</p> <p>Russell scored his second penalty corner goal by sending the ball into the net in the penultimate minute, shattering the hopes of the home side.</p> <p>In the penalty shootout Australia converted all the attempts, while Fitri Saari faltered with the last try for Malaysia.</p> <p>Earlier, Pakistan prevailed 3-1 over Canada, repeating the score-line of their round-robin league encounter on the opneing day, to take the fifth spot.</p> <p>Final placings: Australia 1, India 2, New Zealand 3, Malaysia 4, Pakistan 5, Canada 6, Japan 7.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2756707&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

ts, hockey news, Hockey" /> Coach Roelant Oltmans said he is hopeful of giving world champions Australia a keen contest in the final of the 25th Sultan Azlan Shah Cup. (Source: PTI) <p>Pleased with his wards showing in the 6-1 thrashing of Malaysia in the must-win match, Indian men&#8217;s hockey team coach Roelant Oltmans said he is hopeful of giving world champions Australia a keen contest in the final of the 25th Sultan Azlan Shah Cup, in Ipoh on Saturday.</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pleased to see the energy of the boys. That&#8217;s what you want to see as a coach,&#8221; said Oltmans, who had set a target of finishing among the medalists in the tournament.</p> <p>The Indian victory secured them the second spot in the round-robin league standings with 12 points, edging past defending champions New Zealand on 11 points.</p> <p>Australia duly topped the standings with the maximum 18 points from six successive victories.</p> <p>&#8220;The finals are always special. I want to test and see what our boys will do tomorrow,&#8221; said Oltmans.</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m happy that the team played strongly and applied pressure. That is why we were on top of it throughout. Now we need to focus on the final,&#8221; he said.</p> <p><strong>READ: <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/hockey/india-outplay-malaysia-6-1-to-enter-azlan-shah-cup-final/">India outplay Malaysia 6-1 to enter Azlan Shah Cup final</a></strong></p> <p>&#8220;Playing the final against Australia is a great opportunity for us,&#8221; said the Dutchman, aware of the 5-1 hammering Australia gave to India in their league encounter earlier in the tournament in Ipoh.</p> <p>&#8220;Yes we did lose by a big margin, but the scoreline is a bit harsh. We played a good game, but the outcome was terrible. Tomorrow we ought to try to combine a good game with a good outcome,&#8221; the coach said.</p> <p>Oltmans acknowledged Australia&#8217;s world no. 1 standing but expect his boys to give the Kookaburras a run for their money<br /> on Saturday.</p> <p>&#8220;Australia are the best, there&#8217;s no doubt about that. We hope to give them a good contest,&#8221; he said.</p> <p>Malaysian coach Stephen van Huizen said India&#8217;s early thrust put the game beyond his team&#8217;s reach.</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m disappointed with the early goals, but the boys fought hard,&#8221; said Van Huizen.</p> <p>&#8220;The game was over when we conceded four goals in the first half.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2755364&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

Global Hockey League (GHL) has been introduced for 2019 onwards with Champions Trophy becoming a casualty of the new format.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2755160&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

<img class="size-full wp-image-2755202" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/germany-hockey-759.jpg" alt="global hockey league, ghl, hockey world league, hwl, champions trophy, champions trophy hockey, hockey tournaments, hockey news, hockey" /> Germany won the recent Champions Trophy in India and the tournament will be removed from the calendar in 2018. (Source: AP File) <p>The International Hockey Federation (FIH) is set to introduce drastic changes in the structure of global competitions with a new Global Hockey League (GHL) to be introduced in 2019 in place of the long-standing Champions Trophy, which will be scrapped.</p> <p>FIH president Leandro Negre on Friday said the new GHL will be confined to seven teams and will be played on a home and away basis.</p> <p>This new GHL will take up four months of the sport&#8217;s international calendar from 2019, the FIH chief said. &#8220;The Global Hockey League will be a transformation for international hockey,&#8221; Negre said during the ongoing 25th Sultan Azlan Shah Cup.</p> <p>The FIH has acknowledged that it needed to bring changes to the current Hockey World League, which was introduced after the 2010 Olympics. Negre said two major events, the Hockey World League&#8217;s Semifinals and Finals would no longer feature in the calendar<br /> when the GHL takes off, but the round one and round two tournaments that provide international exposure to the lowly-ranked nations will continue to be part of the new structure.</p> <p>&#8220;We will also have stand-alone qualifiers for the Olympic Games and the World Cup,&#8221; Negre said, which in effect was the role being played until now by the Hockey World League Semifinals.</p> <p>The Champions Trophy will become a casualty of the new format. The Champions Trophy will be be confined to the history after the 2018 edition has been allocated to Amsterdam (The Netherlands).</p> <p>The Champions Trophy was the showpiece annual event in the FIH calendar until the birth of the Hockey World League, rendering the Champions Trophy into a biennial event.</p> <p>The 2018 Champions Trophy will be the third and final edition on the bi-annual roster. Not too long ago, the Champions Trophy was the biggest FIH event outside the Olympics and the World Cup. The seven countries that play in the 2019 GHL are assured of featuring in the elite home-and-away competition for four years, Negre said. He said the GHL would be a nine-team competition from 2021, after which relegation and promotion would be introduced in 2023.</p> <p>Negre said South Africa&#8217;s pullout from the 2016 Olympic Games lineup had prompted serious discussions in the FIH. &#8220;We cannot fight with the National Olympic Committees that do not want to send their teams to the Olympics, but we want all continents to be represented,&#8221; said Negre. &#8220;This is not the first time it has happened and we feel bad that the African continent is not represented in the Olympic competition.&#8221;</p> <p>The FIH, he said, had now decided that if a continent&#8217;s qualifier pulls out and another team from that continent had not qualified, the FIH would step in. &#8220;If no other country from that continent had qualified from the FIH tournament and the continental champion pulled out, we will directly allocate the spot to a country from that continent,&#8221; said Negre. But this nominated country must figure among the top 20 in the FIH rankings, he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2755160&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

India can still ensure a place in final against Australia if they defeat Malaysia in last round-robin league match on April 15th.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2751919&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

<img class="wp-image-2751953 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/mandeep-m.jpg" alt="Mandeep-m" /> India&#8217;s only goal came from Mandeep Singh in the 36th minute against New Zealand. <p>India&#8217;s chances of advancing to the final suffered a blow after they went down 1-2 to defending champions New Zealand in their penultimate round-robin league match of the 25th Azlan Shah Cup hockey tournament on Wednesday.</p> <p>Goals from Ken Russell (28th minute) and Nick Wilson (41st) clinched victory for defending champions New Zealand, who managed to weather the hot and humid conditions better than the Indians, whose only goal came from Mandeep Singh in the 36th minute.</p> <p>Wilson&#8217;s match-winner resulted from a defensive error committed by the Indians as they failed to clear the ball properly in their own striking circle.</p> <p>New Zealand benefitted from the loose ball in the Indian circle in the 41st minute, when a reverse shot from the goal-line was padded by the Indian goalkeeper and deflected to the middle. Defender Harmanpreet failed to connect in his reflex attempt to push the ball out and Wilson had the easiest task of shooting into the goal for what turned out to be the match-winner for the Black Sticks.</p> <p>An Indian victory on Wednesday would have put them in the final, while a draw would have still kept them ahead of New Zealand. But the Black Sticks have now moved ahead into the second spot.</p> <p>India can still ensure a place in the final against Australia if they defeat hosts Malaysia in the last round-robin league match on Friday, while New Zealand will be anxiously waiting to see if they play for the gold medal or the bronze.</p> <p>Australia are still on top of the standings with 12 points from four successive wins, followed by New Zealand on 11 points from six matches. India have nine points from five matches and their fate will rest on the show against Malaysia on Friday.</p> <p>India had to change the choice of their goalkeeper even before the match started as Akash Chikte was struck by a ball on his chest and the team management did not want to take any chances. Harjot Singh came on to the pitch from the start.</p> <p>India earned the first penalty corner in the 20th minute and New Zealand&#8217;s goalkeeper Devon Manchester brought off a fine save by slapping away a soaring drag-flick from Rupinder Pal Singh.</p> <p>Ken Russell opened the scoring for New Zealand with a penalty corner conversion in the 28th minute. His low drag flick got deflected into off defender Manpreet Singh&#8217;s stick into the goal.</p> <p>Pressing for an equaliser, India were rewarded by an opportunity created by Talwinder Singh&#8217;s flash shot from the top of the circle. Not having the luxury of too much space, Talwinder managed to send in a fine shot that Mandeep Singh deflected into the goal.</p> <p>India could have posed a threat to the New Zealand citadel four minutes later when unmarked striker S V Sunil received a high ball on top of the rival circle, but he did not make the opportunity count and sent in a directionless and feeble cross that was cleared without any problem.</p> <p>Next minute, Wilson put New Zealand in front taking advantage of shoddy defending by the Indians, and that turned out to be the match-winner.</p> <p>Looking to restore parity, the Indians forced two penalty corners in the second half, but failed to get past the New Zealand custodian, who moved to his right to make the clearance. The sweaty hands did not seem to make the Indian penalty corner shooter&#8217;s task easy.</p> <p>In the 52nd minute, Chandana Thimmaiah had a good look at the goal and had only the custodian to beat, but his directionless shot simply did not cause any trouble.</p> <p>At the other end, the Indian goal survived some anxious moments in the last quarter when New Zealand enjoyed control of the game. The Indian defence, playing deep near the goal-line, watched the ball sail across the goalmouth in the 57th minute.</p> <p>In a last-gasp effort, India took off the goalkeeper to put in an additional player, but the 69th-minute move also could not help launch a late attack on the New Zealand goal.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2751919&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: Hockey India) <p>A dominant India registered their biggest victory over arch-rivals Pakistan in six years when they coasted to a 5-1 win in a round-robin league match of the 25th Sultan Azlan Shah Cup.</p> <p>This was India&#8217;s biggest win since their 7-4 triumph against Pakistan in the 2010 Commonwealth Games at New Delhi.</p> <p>Playing their best game of the tournament, Manpreet Singh opened the scoring for India in the fourth minute but Pakistan equalised in the seventh through captain Muhammad Irfan.</p> <p>But thereafter it was all India as the Sardar Singh-led side controlled the proceedings with SV Sunil scoring two opportunistic field goals in the 10th and 41st minutes.</p> <p>Talwinder Singh then capitalised on a rebound to score India&#8217;s fourth goal in the 50th minute before Rupinder Pal Singh converted a penalty corner in the 54th minute.</p> <p>India&#8217;s victory would have been bigger had Rupinder converted a penalty stroke in the 55th minute and an deflection into the net by Ramandeep Singh in the 69th was not disallowed after the umpire initially blew for a goal.</p> <p>The victory took India to the second spot in the round-robin league standings with nine points from four outings. The table is being led by world champions Australia on 12 points from four straight wins.</p> <p>Australia took one step into the final when they prevailed 1-0 over Oceania rivals and defending champions New Zealand, who now have eight points from five matches.</p> <p>The all-important goals for Australia was scored by captain Jamie Dwyer, who capitalised on a rebound to shootinto the open goal with the goalkeeper at his mercy.</p> <p>Later in the day, in an exhibition of the sub-continental style of hockey, India lifted their game by leaps and bounds to dominate the match, forcing Pakistan to crowd their territory in the second half to deny Sardar&#8217;s men more goals.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2750443&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

<![CDATA[
early lead, India hung on grimly against several threatening Canadian raids to clinch their second victory in three outings.</p> <p>Nikkin Thimmaiah opened the Indian account in the third minute, but Keegan Pereira equalised for Canada in the 23rd minute to be 1-1 level at half-time. Harmanpreet Singh converted a penalty corner in the 41st minute and Talwinder Singh capitalised on a Sardar Singh cross into the circle in the 67th to seal the fate of the match.</p> <p>With six points from three outings, India are now third in the round-robin league standings. On top of the table are Australia with nine points from three successive wins, followed by New Zealand on eight from four outings.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, Australia outplayed Pakistan 4-0, while New Zealand defeated Japan 4-1.</p> <p>India&#8217;s defence came under a lot of pressure against Canada, who like India are drawn in Group B of the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.</p> <p>Goalkeeper Harjot Singh made a blunder of conceding the first penalty corner, but made a few good saves before he was replaced by Akash Chikte in the second quarter. Both the goalkeepers saved four good cracks at the Indian citadel from the Canadian strikers.</p> <p>India opened the scoring in the third minute off a fine long ball by Rupinder Pal Singh from deep inside the Indian<br /> territory that found unmarked SV Sunil on top of the Canadian circle.</p> <p>Trapping the ball cleanly, Sunil sent a cross that beat goalkeeper David Carter and left Thimmaiah to top the ball<br /> into an open goal. The game thereafter was confined to the midfield until Canada forced their first penalty corner in the 13th minute and the low shot from Gordon Johnston was blocked by Indian custodian Harjot.</p> <p>Harjot again came to India&#8217;s rescue in the next minute when he made another fine save on Pereira&#8217;s lunging reverse<br /> drive from close range.</p> <p>India then had a brief period of domination when they thrice made forays into the rival scoring zone, but failed to get their shots past the compact defence in the crowded circle. It was against the run of play that Canada equalised in<br /> the 23rd minute on a fine counter when a long ball was relayed by Matthew Sermento to Pereira in the circle. With plenty of time and space allowed to him, Pereira made no mistake with his deft shot past the hapless goalkeeper.</p> <p>Talwinder Singh had a chance to put India ahead again in the 27th minute when he received a cross from the left inside the circle, but the Canadian goalkeeper covered his shot well to ward off the danger. Then it was again Canada&#8217;s turn to give India some jitters as Sukhi Panesar took a shy at the goal, followed by two penalty corners in the last two minutes of the first half. One of the penalty corners attempts went wide and Chikte moved well to his right to palm away a low shot.</p> <p>India were put in the lead again in the 41st minute by Harmanpreet&#8217;s rasping drag-flick on their first penalty corner. The stinging shot brooked no denial and ended in the top left corner of the net.</p> <p>Ramandeep Singh had a fine opportunity to bolster the Indian lead in the 45th minute when he received a through ball from captain Sardar Singh in the circle. Ramandeep had only to beat a close-marking defender, but turned around and shot straight into the goalkeeper&#8217;s pads.</p> <p>Canada forced two penalty corners and the Indian defence lived dangerously before the ball sailed across the goal-line. Talwinder capitalised on a fine opening created by Sardar&#8217;s run down in the left flank and the defence splitting<br /> cross to the top of the circle.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2747638&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: PTI) <p>The Indian women&#8217;s hockey team went down 3-4 to Ireland in a penalty shootout to sign off 6th in the Hawke&#8217;s Bay Cup in Hastings on Sunday.</p> <p>Both teams were tied 2-2 after the regulation time.</p> <p>The game started with Ireland attacking strongly and earning a couple of penalty corners early in the quarter, only to be thwarted by the Indian defence.</p> <p>India earned a penalty corner of their own but failed to convert it and the quarter ended goalless.</p> <p>Ireland took the lead four minutes into the second quarter through Deirdre Duke.</p> <p>Namita Toppo&#8217;s field goal in the 25th minute drew India level.</p> <p>Playing at a fast pace, both teams created several opportunities in their hunt for the breakthrough.</p> <p>Disaster struck for India though as Rani injured her ankle and had to be attended by the physio, before eventually being helped off the pitch.</p> <p>The teams went into half time locked at 1-1.</p> <p>Ireland earned several penalty corners in the remaining two quarters, but unlike their last encounter against India, failed to make them count.</p> <p>India&#8217;s defence and goalkeeper Savita held strong and didn&#8217;t allow any of their drag flickers to get a clear shot on goal.</p> <p>Despite a few nervous moments from both sides at the end, the game headed into a shootout.</p> <p>Both teams started off strongly in the shootout, and it took till the third shooter for the first miss as Ireland&#8217;s Anna O&#8217;Flanagan missed with the scores tied at 2-2.</p> <p>Poonam Rani missed her subsequent shot though, which meant India squandered a chance to take the lead.</p> <p>India went on to miss another shot later on, and lost a hard fought encounter 4-3 in the shootout.</p> <p>Speaking after the match Chief Coach Neil Hawgood said, &#8220;We showed an improved performance again today, holding and breaking hard against a team that we had lost to quite badly early in the tournament.</p> <p>Now, we will use these experiences tobuild towards Rio.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2747540&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

<img class="wp-image-2746172 size-full" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/04/manpreet-m.jpg" alt="Manpreet-m" /> Manpreet Singh returned from India after his father&#8217;s funeral to join India on Saturday. (Source: Hockey India) <p>Bolstered by the return of midfielder Manpreet Singh, India will seek to dominate the hard-tackling Canada on Sunday and boost their standing in the 25th Sultan Azlan Shah Cup hockey tournament.</p> <p>The bereaved Manpreet returned from India after his father&#8217;s funeral to join his teammates for a training session on Saturday morning, giving coach Roelant Oltmans some options of tackling the rivals, who on Saturday overtook India on the round-robin league standings.</p> <p>Canada defeated Japan 3-1 to take their points tally to four from three outings, having lost 1-3 to Pakistan and holding defending champions New Zealand to a 1-1 draw.</p> <p>India have three points from two matches, having defeated Japan 2-1 in their opening outings and then suffering a 1-5 defeat by World champions Australia.</p> <p>Manpreet brings a lot of stability to the India&#8217;s game-plan as he often takes up the centre-half&#8217;s duties from Indian captain Sardar Singh when the team is seeking to dominate. When under pressure, Manpreet is adept at playing a deep defender&#8217;s role and falls back to be the third full-back.</p> <p>The news of his father&#8217;s demise reached Manpreet just hours before India&#8217;s opening fixture on Wednesday. He left for home just as the Indian team stepped on to the turf wearing black arm bands and observed a minute&#8217;s silence.</p> <p>In Manpreet&#8217;s absence, the Indian midfield lost its semblance of competitiveness against World champions Australia in the last outing.</p> <p>The Canadians have often proved to be troublesome to the Indians as they pack the defence and bank on quick counter-attacks to exert pressure on the rival citadel.</p> <p>Defending against the quick turnovers has been problem for India and coach Oltmans is seeking to teach the young players in the squad ways to plug the gaps when falling back to defend on counters.</p> <p>Oltmans was seen observing the Canadians from the sidelines, trying to get acquainted with the opponents, whom India do not get to play often. India&#8217;s last encounter with Canada was a year ago here at the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup when India prevailed 5-3.</p> <p>This is the first time the Indian team under coach Oltmans will be taking on Canada, who no longer claim to be the Pan American champions, but are among the four teams at this tournament to have qualified for the Olympics at Rio de Janeiro.</p> <p>Not having played against the Canadians for some time, coach Oltmans is obviously vary of the surprise element.</p> <p>Skipper Sardar, who has played against Canada several times in the past, says India will go out looking for full points in tomorrow&#8217;s encounter.</p> <p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be looking to repeat out winning show of last year against Canada, but they are not to be taken lightly,&#8221; said Sardar.</p> <p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve provided exposure to a lot out our youngsters here,&#8221; Sardar said. &#8220;The coach has come to this tournament with specific targets and the gains will be visible with every match.&#8221;</p> <p>Canada captain Scott Tupper expressed happiness at the way his team was playing.</p> <p>&#8220;We take a lot of pride in our game and that should show every time we get on the pitch,&#8221; Tupper said.</p> <p>Playing a close-marking game and banking on quick turnovers, the Canadians held defending champions New Zealand to a 1-1 draw on Friday.</p> <p>The way the Canadians have played in the last two games is quite different from their show in the opening fixture against Pakistan, which they lost 1-3 in extreme hot and humid conditions.</p> <p>Coach Anthony Farry expects the match against India to be tough, but promised to put up a keen contest.</p> <p>&#8220;India&#8217;s got some super-fast players and we need to be at our best to tackle them,&#8221; said Farry. &#8220;We have an idea about the way the Indians play and we&#8217;re eager to play better than we&#8217;ve done so far in this tournament.</p> <p>&#8220;We&#8217;re getting comfortable playing against top teams, but it does not stop us from improving,&#8221; Farry added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2746143&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

first match for KKR this season. (Source: PTI) <p>Opening up about his astonishing comeback and fitness level at 45, Australian spinner Brad Hogg today said he gets a healthy dose of constant encouragement from his wife that keeps him going, but conceded he regrets quitting Test cricket after just seven outings.</p> <p>Hogg is presently enjoying his Indian Premier League stint at Kolkata Knight Riders.</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good to be playing the game with someone who&#8217;s pushing you to go as far as you want. There&#8217;s talk about me when I&#8217;m going to stop and she just says play as long as you possibly can. We&#8217;re going to try get there to fifty,&#8221; Hogg said on the eve of their match against Mumbai Indians.</p> <p>Hogg was the pick of KKR bowler with figures of 3/19 as Delhi Daredevils succumbed to 98 to suffer a nine-wicket defeat in their IPL opener.</p> <p>Having spent much time in the shadow of the legendary Shane Warne, Hogg had called it quits in 2008 after just seven Tests and 123 ODIs.</p> <p>Hogg regretted his Test retirement and blamed it on his personal issues with his former wife.</p> <p>&#8220;I do regret retiring back in 2008. I had a Test berth for Australia at that stage but I had some personal issues with family and yes, I retired there. I wish I didn&#8217;t because the marriage did not survive. Luckily it did not because I met a new partner and she&#8217;s wonderful and someone who supports me.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s just having the passion of wanting to play. Everyone knows I retired in 2008, had about two-three years out of the game. To have here and do have an opportunity what you love, I don&#8217;t take it for granted. I just love it, I still have the passion of a five year old kid when I first had that dream of playing for Australia. The game&#8217;s changed, it&#8217;s evolved. It&#8217;s given a new lease of life to cricket and it&#8217;s given a new lease of life to me. It&#8217;s just having that<br /> passion.&#8221;</p> <p>Elaborating on his fitness regime, he said: &#8220;Basically I try to do everything everyday. I try to have two days off but still doing something physical. I really have five days where I go really hard an hour and a bit, make sure I keep the fitness up. Once you stop, you lose it and I don&#8217;t want to lose it now.</p> <p>&#8220;I guess when I had that period where I had the couple of years off where I was coaching and I thought myself better I keep fit. Luckily I did but I don&#8217;t want to go back and coach those kids. I will try and stay healthy as possibly as I can for the rest of my life.</p> <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be in a hospital when I&#8217;m sixty with something that I could have avoided. That&#8217;s probably the main reason why I keep healthy.&#8221;</p> <p>With Kolkata Knight Riders&#8217; premier spinner Sunil Narine back in the squad, Hogg&#8217;s place in the team may be uncertain but the Australian veteran said they share a lot of mutual respect.</p> <p>Terming the West Indian off-spinner as a class act, Hogg said: &#8220;He (Narine) is sorely missed. It&#8217;s disappointing with what happened with him personally and with his action. He&#8217;s a class act, he&#8217;s got the skill. He&#8217;s sorely missed through that World Twenty20. It&#8217;s great to have him back.</p> <p>&#8220;As individuals, we want to be on par. But it&#8217;s a team. If I&#8217;m not playing and he takes my spot, I still have got to create the energy in the changing room and make sure everyone is up for the challenge. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether you&#8217;re playing or not, you still can play a part,&#8221; he said.</p> <p>With his childlike enthusiasm, Hogg said he always keeps the dressing room alive.</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fairly energetic. If I&#8217;m quiet, upset and get stressed because I&#8217;m not playing, everyone else will feel that and will bring everyone down. I cannot afford to do that. It&#8217;s a team game and we all play a part. When we get our chances in the middle, we got to do our role,&#8221; said the 45-year-old chinaman bowler.</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good having myself and Sunil putting the pressure and when we put pressure on each other to perform it&#8217;s good and respectful competition between us,&#8221; he said.</p> <p>Cleared by the ICC after a remedial action, Narine had to rush back home due to father&#8217;s demise.</p> <p>&#8220;Hope his family is well after the passing of his father. It&#8217;s sad news but life goes on and hopefully we can put him into a great space when he gets in,&#8221; Hogg said.</p> <p>Hogg said Narine would not lose any sting in his bowling.</p> <p>&#8220;I remember taking some balls from him and his action was perfect. We all know he can do it without the restriction, he can do it legitimately. Let me tell you I was struggling to pick him up from other end when he was bowling the doosra and I thought it was going the other way.&#8221;</p> <p>Talking about the impact of spinners in Twenty20, Hogg said the Australians had a different perspective and thought the tribe would cease to exit in the batsmen-friendly format but only to be proved wrong.</p> <p>&#8220;When T20 came we at Australian team thought spinners are going to die. But it&#8217;s great to see especially in IPL and the Big Bash League back home teams are going with two frontline spinners.</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just great because we&#8217;re covering all aspects of the game. We&#8217;ve seen spin, pace, medium pacer. It&#8217;s just great to see the game evolved and see T20 cricket not taking aspects of the game away that we all respected in the longer form of the game of Test cricket. T20 has really enlightened Test as well, taken skills from the Test and put it in an exciting way for the youngsters today,&#8221; Hogg said.</p> <p>The chinaman bowler said in T20 the bowlers would have to show respect to every batsman irrespective of their experience.</p> <p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter whether I&#8217;m bowling to an inexperienced or an experience player. The time that you think you&#8217;re bowling to an inexperienced player, you mentally switch off for that minute thinking that it would be easy,&#8221; he said.</p> <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the time you get punished. It&#8217;s very hard to switch off and get back when you&#8217;re in a tough situation. In a tournament like this, it doesn&#8217;t matter whether experienced or inexperienced I approach in the same way.&#8221;</p> <p>Talking about young Australian leg-spinner Adam Zampa, he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen him grow very quickly. He&#8217;s got very good mental strength. When you get to that level, it&#8217;s not about your skill but your mental strength and hanging in there.</p> <p>&#8220;When chips are down, you&#8217;re hit for a six, you see the ball going past but you have the same attitude the next ball. He does not drop his head, that&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve learnt from him. He&#8217;s very good in that department.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2750619&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: PTI) <p>The Bombay High Court on Tuesday asked the BCCI whether it could shift IPL matches out of Pune in view of the grim water crisis in Maharashtra even as the cricket board said it would procure treated sewage water for maintenance of pitches in Mumbai and Pune.</p> <p>A bench of Justices V M Kanade and M S Karnik, hearing a PIL by NGO Loksatta Movement challenging use of large quantities of water in stadiums at a time when the state was reeling under severe drought conditions, asked the BCCI to respond to this by Wednesday.</p> <p>The judges also asked the board whether it can contribute to the Chief Minister&#8217;s drought relief fund.</p> <p>As the BCCI said it had supplied 40 lakh litres of water to stadiums per day for IPL tournaments so far, the judges asked whether it was ready to supply the same quantity to water-starved villages in and around Pune.</p> <p>During the hearing, the Cricket Board counsel Rafiq Dada informed the bench that BCCI had tied up with Royal Western India Turf Club (RWITC) to procure treated sewage water for IPL matches to be played in Mumbai and Pune.</p> <p>Nine Indian Premier League (IPL) matches have been planned in Pune and eight in Mumbai, where the opneing match was held on April 9 at Wankhede stadium here, the BCCI&#8217;s counsel told the court.</p> <p>Three matches are slated to be held in Nagpur, and IPL franchise Kings XI Punjab has agreed to shift them to Mohali or elsewhere if the HC tells it, he said.</p> <p>Everyday, 7-8 tankers of treated sewage water would be supplied to the stadiums, Dada said, adding use of treated sewage water should be encouraged because after treating it is released into the sea and goes wasted now, he said.</p> <p>&#8220;In this case, instead of discharging treated sewage water into the sea, we are using it in the stadiums,&#8221; the BCCI counsel said.</p> <p>The bench also asked RWITC to give an undertaking whether it would supply treated sewage water for the ground maintenance in Pune.</p> <p>The HC had lambasted the BCCI during the last hearing on the use of huge quantities of water for the pitches.</p> <p>The BCCI Counsel said that after the High Court pulled up the cricket Board for using water in stadiums it has taken the issue very seriously.</p> <p>In another development, Maharashtra acting Advocate General Rohit Dev informed the court of the immediate and long term measures the Government would adopt to meet the drought situation.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2750595&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

It, therefore, comes as little surprise that Royal Challengers of Bangalore (RCB) have always started as the overwhelming favourites before every edition of the IPL.

(Express File Photo by Mahendra Parikh) <p>A lot of people have come to Harsha Bhogle&#8217;s aid after one of the most popular cricket commentators was given the sack from the on-going Indian Premier League. To make things even murkier, there is no clear reasoning to justify the decision. <strong>(<a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/indian-premier-league-t20-2016-schedule-full-fixtures-results-schedule-time-and-more/">Fixtures</a> | <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ipl-2016-schedule-teams-tickets-squad-auction-9-streaming/">Squads</a>)</strong></p> <p><strong>READ: <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ipl-2016-commentary-team-like-pizza-without-exotic-toppings-harsha-bhogle-retweets-sanjay-manjrekar-amused/">IPL 2016 commentary like pizza without exotic toppings</a></strong></p> <p>To be fair, Bhogle has been one of the most recognisable voices in Indian cricket from his days with All India Radio to rise with TV commentary. And he has the knack of using apt metaphors and witty one-liners to put his point across.</p> <p><strong>Harsha to Geoffrey Boycott on Sachin Tendulkar&#8217;s Lord&#8217;s record</strong></p> <p>During the lunch time show after Sachin&#8217;s last Test innings at Lord&#8217;s.</p> <p>Geoffrey Boycott : &#8220;Sachin maybe a great batsmen but he has never been on the Lords honours boards!&#8221;</p> <p>Harsha Bhogle : &#8220;So whose loss is it more, Sachin&#8217;s or the honours board&#8217;s?&#8221;</p> <p><strong>India vs England at the Champions Trophy at Edgebaston in 2013 </strong></p> <p>Michael Atherton: It is England but India has more support in the stadium, and the pitch is completely assisting your spinners. Says a lot about our hospitality, right?</p> <p>Harsha Bhogle: Well, we let you rule our nation for so many years. Says a lot about our hospitality, right?</p> <p><strong>Harsha Bhogle on Chris Gayle&#8217;s style of play during the IPL</strong></p> <p>Harsha Bhogle: &#8220;6 and 4 seems to have become the new binary code for this man (Chris Gayle).&#8221;</p> <p><strong>After Sachin Tendulkar played a trademark, glorious drive off Ishant Sharma in the IPL</strong></p> <p>Harsha Bhogle: &#8220;Open the textbook, turn to page 32!&#8221;</p> <p><strong>During the tri-series involving India, Australia and England in 2015, Harsha took a clever jibe at Sourav Ganguly</strong></p> <p>Sourav Ganguly: &#8220;To be honest, I really enjoy hearing you talk about the game Harsha. So much passion, so much in touch with the game. You&#8217;ve been around for a while though.&#8221;</p> <p>Harsha Bhogle: &#8220;But i never took my shirt off.&#8221;</p> <p><strong>WATCH: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbFCRiSD7vQ">Keystrokes- Harsha Bhogle, Amitabh Bachchan, MS Dhoni</a></strong><br /> [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbFCRiSD7vQ&amp;w=640&amp;h=390]</p> <p><strong>After multiple reprieves for Virender Sehwag in New Zealand</strong></p> <p>Harsha Bhogle&#8221;It&#8217;s that kind of a day. Sehwag can walk blindfolded across a busy highway today and not get run over.&#8221;</p> <p><strong>When Sachin got out to part-timer Michael Vaughan in 2002</strong></p> <p>Harsha Bhogle: &#8220;Oh what a shame! It&#8217;s like a soldier who survived the war when all the bullets were flying by his nose and then got run over by a cycle in his native town&#8221;</p> <p><strong>Harsha Bhogle summing up &#8216;The Wall&#8217; Rahul Dravid</strong></p> <p>Harsha Bhogle: &#8220;Is there a more calming sight in the world than Rahul Dravid taking guard?&#8221;</p> <p><strong>During a KKR vs RCB match in IPL in 2013 </strong></p> <p>Harsha Bhogle: &#8220;Running is going to be interesting here, because AB de Villiers is a hare between the wickets and Chris Gayle does it only because the law requires him to go across to the other end.&#8221;</p> <p><strong>On Rajat Bhatia&#8217;s gentle bowling:</strong></p> <p>Harsha Bhogle: &#8220;Any bowler has three pace variations &#8211; fast, medium and slow. But Rajat Bhatia has slow , slower and slowest.&#8221;</p> <p><strong>Harsha Bhogle displays his quick wit once again to Nasser Hussain</strong></p> <p>Nasser Hussain: &#8220;When can I see India playing in a football World Cup?&#8221; (this was during 2014 FIFA World Cup)</p> <p>Harsha Bhogle : &#8220;It&#8217;s better not to participate rather than getting knocked out in the first round.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2750273&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: File) <p>Miffed with Lasith Malinga&#8217;s attitude of picking and choosing tournaments, the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) is reluctant to give the fast bowler &#8216;No Objection Certificate&#8217; to play for the Mumbai Indians in the ongoing Indian Premier League.</p> <p>SLC chief Tilanga Sumathipala said that the current status of Malinga&#8217;s fitness needs to be assessed before the Board decides to give him the NOC.</p> <p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t go without our permission.

Serena Williams has reached the last four at Melbourne Park on six previous occasions and gone on to win the title every time.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2642523&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: Reuters) <p>Reigning champion Serena Williams ramped up the power in the second set to vanquish fifth seed Maria Sharapova for the 18th match in a row and reach the semi-finals of the Australian Open with a 6-4 6-1 victory on Tuesday.</p> <p>Sharapova broke the world number one in the first game and mounted a stiff challenge in the opening set but wilted in the second to extend a losing record that goes back 12 years.</p> <p>Williams said the Russian brings out the best in her.</p> <p>&#8220;When I play her, I know automatically I have to step up my game,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;I think that makes me play better. When I&#8217;m forced to play better, I do well.&#8221;</p> <p>The gulf between Williams and Sharapova, a former number one and five-times grand slam champion, speaks volumes about the balance of power in the women&#8217;s game.</p> <p>Williams has reached the last four at Melbourne Park on six previous occasions and gone on to win the title every time.</p> <p>On Tuesday&#8217;s evidence, it looks like only illness or injury can prevent the 34-year-old from repeating the feat and adding a 22nd major title to her collection.</p> <p>The American, who came into the tournament after a four-month layoff, twice had treatment for &#8220;food poisoning issues&#8221; during breaks in the 92-minute rematch of last year&#8217;s final.</p> <p>Sharapova handed back her early break with two double faults in game four but started the match well and offered a genuine test in the 55-minute opening stanza.</p> <p>The Russian showed character to storm back from 0-40 down to hold serve for 4-4 and was all over Williams&#8217;s serve in the next game, the American yelling &#8220;C&#8217;mon!&#8221; on successive points as she finally held.</p> <p>The match turned on the next game when Sharapova fended off three set points despite failing to get her first serve in before Williams converted the fourth after a long rally with a volley at the net.</p> <p>Sharapova had fired 21 aces in her fourth round match but managed just seven against Williams.</p> <p>&#8220;I think if you&#8217;re serving maybe 180 (kph) against somebody else compared to Serena, that&#8217;s an ace,&#8221; said the 28-year-old.</p> <p>&#8220;Against Serena, as we all know, the return is one of her great strengths. She&#8217;s very explosive. She stays quite close to the baseline.</p> <p>&#8220;She cuts the ball early. She doesn&#8217;t give you many angles.&#8221;</p> <p>Williams has an 8-0 record against her semi-final opponent Agnieszka Radwanska, who as the fourth seed is the highest ranked challenger remaining in the draw.</p> <p>&#8220;Nothing&#8217;s guaranteed in sports,&#8221; said Williams. &#8220;I still have to win two matches against potentially two extremely tough opponents.&#8221;</p> <p><strong>Radwanska into semis</strong></p> <p>Fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska advanced to her second Australian Open semi-final after beating Spain&#8217;s Carla Suarez Navarro 6-1 6-3 at Rod Laver Arena on Tuesday.</p> <p>The 26-year-old Pole jumped out to a 4-0 lead with two breaks of serve in the first set, and while the Spaniard finally managed to hold in the fifth game, Radwanska broke again on her second set point to seal it in 28 minutes.</p> <p>Radwanska opened up a 2-0 lead in the second but then neither player held serve for the next three games until 10th seed Suarez Navarro won an 11-minute sixth game to level at 3-3.</p> <p>Radwanska, who also made the last four in 2014, broke again in the eighth game before serving out for the match.</p> <p>She will next meet either defending champion Serena Williams or 2008 winner Maria Sharapova, who are up next on Rod Laver Arena.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2642523&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: AP) <p>Andy Murray would not have continued playing at the Australian Open if his father-in-law&#8217;s health had deteriorated following his collapse at Rod Laver Arena, the world number two said on Monday.</p> <p>Nigel Sears, who is the coach of Ana Ivanovic, fell ill during the Serb&#8217;s third-round match against Madison Keys on Saturday and was taken to hospital..</p> <p>He was discharged on Sunday and cleared to return to Britain.</p> <p>Murray, who was playing his own third-round match on the adjacent Margaret Court Arena, was oblivious to Sears&#8217;s collapse until afterwards and rushed straight to hospital following his victory.</p> <p>The 28-year-old Briton plans to leave Melbourne if his pregnant wife Kim goes into labour early and he said after his fourth-round win over Bernard Tomic on Monday that the same would have applied if Sears&#8217;s condition had worsened.</p> <p>&#8220;Obviously it depended on Nigel&#8217;s health,&#8221; Murray said. &#8220;If the news was not positive, then, no, there was absolutely no chance I would have kept playing.&#8221;</p> <p>Murray returned to Melbourne Park on Sunday to resume practice having spent a few hours with Sears. The incident had shaken him up, he said, but he was now pleased the 58-year-old was on his way home.</p> <p>&#8220;It was a tough few days. Certainly wasn&#8217;t straightforward,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Just glad that he&#8217;s on his way home now and can be back with his family.&#8221;</p> <p>Murray said he felt &#8220;drained&#8221; on Monday after expecting to find some sanctuary on the court, the incident had still affected him throughout the match against Tomic.</p> <p>Several times he was talking to, and chastising, himself for the way he was playing, which used a lot of energy and he found himself going through a roller coaster of emotions.</p> <p>&#8220;Certainly I was trying to just concentrate on the match when I was out there, but it&#8217;s been a hard, hard few days,&#8221; he said.</p> <p>&#8220;I just can&#8217;t believe something like that happened. It&#8217;s &#8230;very, very scary.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2641958&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: Reuters) <p>The business end of the Australian Open begins in earnest on Tuesday when top seed Serena Williams faces old rival Maria Sharapova for a place in the semi-finals in a repeat of last year&#8217;s title match.</p> <p>In the men&#8217;s draw defending champion Novak Djokovic, taken to five sets in the fourth round, will have to improve as he faces Japanese seventh seed Kei Nishikori while Roger Federer aims to continue his smooth progress against Tomas Berdych.</p> <p>Sharapova will be desperate to avenge last year&#8217;s final loss to Williams, although the omens are not good for the Russian.</p> <p>She has lost her last 17 matches against the 34-year-old Williams and the American 21-times grand slam champion has been in dominant form so far in Melbourne after some pre-tournament injury concerns.</p> <p>Williams remains wary though, saying such a one-sided statistic can work both ways.</p> <p>&#8220;I think the person who&#8217;s winning could definitely feel the pressure because there is a lot of expectations,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The person who is losing  X amount in a row could think &#8216;I don&#8217;t have anything to lose.'&#8221;</p> <p>Djokovic&#8217;s bid for a sixth Australian Open title was nearly sabotaged by Gilles Simon in round four and the in-form Nishikori will pose a serious threat as he attempts to prevent Djokovic reaching a 29th grand slam semi-final.</p> <p>Nishikori beat Djokovic the last time they met in a grand slam, at the 2014 U.S. Open semi-final, and will need to reproduce that form on Tuesday.</p> <p>&#8220;I think the biggest thing is he doesn&#8217;t miss,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t give you easy points, any free points.&#8221;</p> <p>Federer takes on a familiar foe in Berdych, with the pair facing each other for the 22nd time.</p> <p>The Swiss is on a four-match winning streak against the powerful Czech, but has lost their last two grand slam meetings.</p> <p>Berdych will look to pull off another major upset, as he did at the same stage last year when he ended a 17-match losing streak against Rafael Nadal.</p> <p>Fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska opens the action on Rod Laver Arena when she battles it out with 10th seeded Spaniard Carla Suarez Navarro.</p> <p>The 26-year-old scrapped through to the quarter-finals after being pushed to her limits by Germany&#8217;s Anna-Lena Friedsam in the previous round.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2641959&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

Russia is currently banned from all athletics after a series of doping scandals and has to convince the IAAF that it has put in place remedial measures.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2764332&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

ics news, athletics" /> Elena Lashmanova is one of the many Russian athletes who stand to lose out if Russian athletes are banned from Rio Olympics. (AP File Photo) <p>Russian athletics has been given a longer than expected period to prove it has made enough progress in reforming its anti-doping operation to be re-instated to the sport in time to take part in the Rio Olympics</p> <p>The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) announced on Thursday that its next Council meeting, when the Russian situation will be discussed and almost certainly decided, will take place in Vienna on June 17. After the last Council meeting in March, IAAF president Sebastian Coe said he expected it to be in May.</p> <p>Russia, second behind the United States in the athletics medal table at the 2012 London Olympics, is banned from all athletics after an independent commission of the World Anti-Doping Agency revealed widespread state-sponsored doping.</p> <p>The country now has to convince the IAAF that it has put in place measures to show improvement in its anti-doping operation and a &#8220;change of culture.&#8221;</p> <p>Mikhail Butov, general secretary of the Russian athletics federation, told Reuters on Thursday: &#8220;We were expecting this, now we will continue to work together with the IAAF working group.</p> <p>&#8220;Another meeting will take place in two days time. A massive amount of work has already been done, but there is still a lot ahead of us. Of course we hope that there will be a positive decision.&#8221;</p> <p>Last month Norwegian Rune Andersen, who heads the five-person international task force reviewing Russia&#8217;s reforms after its suspension from global competition in November, said there had been &#8220;significant progress&#8221;, including changing its president and council and developing anti-doping educational programmes.</p> <p>&#8220;However, the view of the task force is that there is significant work still to be done to satisfy the reinstatement conditions&#8230;.we still need to interview athletes and coaches named in the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) commission report to understand the scope and nature of previous doping activities,&#8221; Anderson said in March.</p> <p>The Rio athletics program begins on Aug. 12 but registration must be completed about a month before that which would leave little time for the vast majority of Russian athletes who would still need to record Olympic-standard qualifying times.</p> <p>Russian sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said last month that his country had done enough to be reinstated, saying it had not been made clear exactly what it still had to do to satisfy the IAAF.</p> <p>&#8220;You say we should elect new leadership for the athletics federation. OK, we&#8217;ve done that. You should not elect anyone to be the leader who has done this or that. OK, we did that,&#8221; he said.</p> <p>&#8220;There are no criteria,&#8221; he added. &#8220;What should Russian athletics do? Dance on the table? Sing a song?&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2764332&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

The friend told the 911 operator that Laurer wasn&#8217;t breathing.</p> <p>The 46-year-old Laurer was dead when officers arrived, police said.</p> <p>Neither police nor coroner&#8217;s officials have released any cause of death. An autopsy was planned in the next few days.</p> <p>Laurer billed herself as the &#8220;9th Wonder of the World&#8221; because her wrestling predecessor Andre the Giant had already called himself the eighth.</p> <p>She was a member of the wrestling squad that dubbed itself &#8216;D-Generation X,&#8217; often wrestled against men and at one point was the WWE women&#8217;s champion. After leaving the WWE in 2001, Laurer posed for Playboy and appeared in adult films and on reality TV, including the shows &#8216;The Surreal Life&#8217; and &#8220;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew.&#8221;</p> <p>A statement posted Wednesday night on her website reads, &#8220;Today we lost a true icon, a real life superhero. Joanie Laurer aka Chyna, the 9th Wonder of the World has passed away. She will live forever in the memories of her millions of fans and all of us that loved her.&#8221;</p> <p>Laurer was a native of Rochester, New York, and graduated from the University of Tampa in Florida before taking up wrestling.</p> <p>She joins a long list of WWE professional wrestlers who have died relatively young, including Rick Rude, Curt &#8220;Mr. Perfect&#8221; Hennig, the Ultimate Warrior and Owen Hart.</p> <p>This story has been updated to reflect that Laurer was 46, according to a police statement.</p> <p>Associated Press writer Andrew Dalton contributed to this report.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2763751&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

Shiv Kapur says that he got a lot of positives from his debut and feels he would move up the leaderboard. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2087872&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

<p><em>By <strong>Shiv Kapur</strong></em></p> <p>The butterflies were there alright, but I managed to control them well. I got off to a great start, but could not keep it up over the second stretch after starting on the tenth.</p> <p>I played a solid first nine, which was the back stretch of the course. I hit the ball really well from tee to green. Though I gave away a few shots on the second nine, I was satisfied with the round, but I did leave the course with a feeling that I left a couple of shots there. The course was firming up as the day went on. I got out of danger a few times and scrambled well to keep the momentum going. But I was very disappointed with the bogey on the last. I felt one-over would have been a great score.</p> <p>Two not-so-good second shots and a bad drive cost me three strokes and then the disappointing bogey on the ninth meant I was three-over. I opened with three pars and had my first birdie ever at an US Open after driving with a 3-iron and following it up with a 9-Iron on the par-4 13th, which was playing to just over 390 yards. I was on the green within six feet and the birdie felt great. It was to be my only birdie.</p> <p>I had a perfect drive on the 18th, but missed the second shot on the left and Pinehurst penalized me with a bogey. On the very next hole, the first, I put my second shot in the greenside bunker. From the bunker I was unable to get up and down. I pulled the drive on the fifth left and had to chip out, which led to another bogey. Then the ninth got me again.</p> <p>Yet, I would say I got a lot of positives from my debut and feel like I can carry that on to today’s round and that would help me move up the leaderboard.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2087872&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

(Source: Reuters )" /></a> Kaymer watches his tee shot on the 18th hole during the second round of the U.S. Open in Pinehurst, North Carolina on Friday. (Source: Reuters ) <p>Martin Kaymer took advantage of a rain-softened Pinehurst layout to stretch his overnight lead at the U.S. Open to a commanding six shots with five holes to play in the second round on Friday.</p> <p>The 29-year-old German, three ahead of the chasing pack after opening with a five-under-par 65 that he described as “exceptional”, birdied four of his first 13 holes under sunny skies to move to nine under for the tournament. That left him six strokes in front of his closest pursuers, burly Zimbabwean Brendon de Jonge and long-hitting American Dustin Johnson.</p> <p>De Jonge, who had carded a 68 on Thursday, was one under for the day after 15 holes while Johnson, who opened with a 69, was two under for his round with four holes remaining. Northern Ireland&#8217;s Graeme McDowell, the 2010 U.S. Open champion at Pebble Beach, and American Kevin Na were at two under for the tournament but yet to start the second round.</p> <p>Kaymer, who gained a major confidence boost from his victory at the elite Players Championship last month, has played near-flawless golf at challenging Pinehurst over the last two days in the year&#8217;s second major. His opening 65 included six birdies and a lone bogey and the former world number one was error-free for his first 13 holes on Friday.</p> <p>With barely a breath of wind on Pinehurst&#8217;s fabled No. 2 Course which was softened by 0.64 inches of rain overnight, Kaymer birdied the 10th, 13th and 16th to reach the turn in three-under 32.</p> <p>World number one Adam Scott, who had struggled with his short game on the way to an opening 73, was two under for the day after 13 holes but a distant 10 strokes behind Kaymer.</p> <p>Leaderboard: Martin Kaymer 130; Brooks Koepka 138; Dustin Johnson 138; Brendon de Jonge 138; Keegan Bradley 138.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2087871&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />
